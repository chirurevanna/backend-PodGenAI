  "transcription": "Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Josh Waitzkin. Josh Waitzkin is a former child prodigy who began playing the game of chess at 6 years old and by the time he was 16 years old had become a national champion many times over as well as an international champion. In fact, he achieved the level of international master which is one of the highest levels of achievement in the game of chess for anyone of any age. His early life achievements were the topic and focus of the book and movie Searching for Bobby Fischer. He then quit playing the game of chess and moved on to martial arts, the study of philosophy at Columbia University in New York and eventually foiling, which is essentially surfing over the water. Josh is not only a high performer, he has now become perhaps the most sought after professional.",
