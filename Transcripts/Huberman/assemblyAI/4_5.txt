  "transcription": "Before we get to the origins of the universe and the organization of the planets relative to the sun and their spins, et cetera, you said something that, at least to me, feels intuitively so true, and I think it's very likely to be true for everybody, which is that there's something about looking up into space, especially at night, when we see the stars, and hopefully see the stars, we'll talk about light pollution a little bit later when we see the stars, that, yes, we know these things are far away, yes, we know that they occupy a certain position in space, they have a diameter, et cetera. We might not know what that is just by looking at them. You probably do. But they also change our perception of time. And if I were to say one thing about the human brain especially, it's is that, sure, it's got all these autonomic functions. It regulates heart rate, digestion, et cetera, sleep, wake cycles. It can remember, it can think, it can have states like rage or anger or happiness or delight. But what's remarkable about the human brain is that it can think into the past, it can be quote, unquote present, and it can project into the future. And I'm sure other animals can do that. But we do this exquisitely well and we make plans on the basis of this ability to contract or expand our notion of time. As a non biologist, but somebody who I think appreciates and understands biology, why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky, even though most people might not realize that those stars probably aren't there and occupying the position that we think they are, some of them probably are, some of them aren't. They existed a long time ago. But without knowing that, why do you think that looking up at the stars gives, gives us the sense of an expansion of time as opposed to just the expansion of space? Hmm. Well, first of all, we have to take ourselves back, you know, to deep prehistory. We know that ancients were looking at the constellations because they were seemingly either in control of or correlated with, or perhaps causative of the seasons. And that was of divine importance, supreme importance for them, right? Their whole existence in early agrarian societies, hunting societies, gathering societies. So they had to know about time. So time, the essence of time, and that on large scale, for seasons, for holidays, for festivals, for propitiation of deities and so forth, they had to keep track of it. And that's why in the caves in Lascaux that date Back to the 40,000 BCE, they depict constellations. Orion the hunter, Taurus the bull. All these different constellations, they depict them there now partially that was because Netflix didn't exist back then. Right. There was no TikTok and so there wasn't much to do at night. And in fact, the more you were out at night, you probably increased your opportunity to be consumed by some predator. Right. So you were more focused on being stationary observing. And as I said, we can do astronomy uniquely so amongst all the sciences with just the equipment we're born with, you know, measurements with our eyes with respect to landmarks to calculate patterns. And humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns, sometimes too good. So for instance, knowing that a certain swath of stars is present at one time of year and not another relative to say, the contour of a mountain ridge. Yes. And the repetition of it and passed down through generations before there was written language, there was pictography, there was the cave paintings and so forth, there was oral language and that was it for, you know, written language is only, you know, 10,000 years old or something like that. So to store information that meant it was a continuity between generations, my great, great, great great grandfathers, elders, whatever taught me that when the moon is in this constellation, the sun is in this constellation, we should plant or we should harvest another in other times. And so it was, and we still do use the, you know, the rotation of the Earth, you know, hasn't changed that much since this 40,000 year period. Right. I mean the axis in which it rotates, that, that's a different story. But, but the, the actual spin rate, the angular momentum of the Earth has not depreciably changed that much. And so the positions of these objects were of such importance that the ancients would use them for all these purposes. But there were so few things that changed position that they actually had names for them. They're called planets. So planet in Greek it's like the word plane, like airplane, it means something that moves or wanders. So when you name something, it means it's pretty different from the other things in which are not associated with that characteristic. So the planets there were only five that they could see at that time up to Saturn. And they actually would associate those not only with astronomical events, but events down on Earth. That's what connected the Earth. So we have legacy of that in our calendar today. So Sunday, named after the sun, Monday, moon, Tuesday, and you go to the Latin languages, I think it's Mercurdi, which is Mercury.",
