  "transcription": "And now for my discussion with Dr. Jordan Peterson. Dr. Jordan Peterson, welcome. Thank you, sir. Delighted to have you here and want to talk about elements within your new book. Also some elements within your previous books and within that mind of yours generally. As a framework for that. I'm wondering if you would tolerate or permit a little bit of a discussion about sort of brain and psychology. Just kind of lay the groundwork for where we might prod some of the themes that you bring up related to the book. So I view the brain as obviously a bunch of cells and parts, et cetera, but I distill it down to some basic features. First of all, we have an autonomic physiology, I think we'd both agree on that, that regulates our sleepiness and wakefulness, our breathing, our heart rate, stuff that runs in the background. And then we have a lot of circuitry devoted to what I would call impulses, things that we desire, we want to move toward appetitive behaviors. And we also have some impulses to avoid things that are putrid, painful, etc. That's all in there, like it is in other areas. We should talk about the idea of impulse in relationship to that characterization. Okay. Because there's an important. There's an important point to be made on the. You pay a price for characterizing that as impulse. And I'd like to explore that with you because it's crucial. Great. We'll circle back to impulse. I'd like to do that. And then we have a lot of circuitry. People will hear about it as executive function, prefrontal circuitry, which does many things. But I like to think of as a circuit that can say. And here I'm borrowing from a previous guest who's a neurosurgeon, it can say, shh, or exert what's called top down suppression on these, what I'm calling impulses. It can. We should talk about that too. The suppression idea and the inhibition idea in general. Great. Because there's. I think there's a parallel problem there to the notion of impulse that's very much worth delving into. Great. So circuitry that's devoted to our ability to self inhibit the desire to reach for something or to avoid something. We can push ourselves into things that would otherwise be aversive. We can avoid doing things that would otherwise drive us to, quote unquote, just do it anyway. And then we have what I think of as our default settings, kind of how we're operating in the world with respect to food, other people, ourselves, our thoughts. If we don't intervene with ourselves. And these default settings are of course established by both nature, a genetic program that wires up circuitry, but also nurture because of the immense neuroplasticity that occurs in the first 25 years plus of life, but especially those first years of life. Then of course, we have neuroplasticity, this incredible gift that humans have more of than any other species as far as we know, which is we can decide to make changes. Now, the reason I lay out this framework, as opposed to starting with a question, is because there are so many amazing questions that you ask in this book. You know, we who wrestle with God, I mean, trying to wrap our arms and minds around this huge set of questions. And it occurred to me, just step back from all of that and ask, is part of the reason that we have a concept of God, that there are multiple religions, is that the consequence of some humans at some point realizing, or perhaps God himself realizing that what we are equipped with as humans, which we just described, is insufficient to allow us to evolve as a species and be the best version of ourselves? I think this for me really is the central question of at least my life, which is to what extent do I need to intervene with my default settings, rewire them, engage that prefrontal cortex and push down on some appetitive or aversive behaviors? And to what extent can we do that? And to what end? And to what end? And maybe we need a rule book. You know, I am starting to believe, and I'm now 49 years old, that we need a rule book. That the neural circuitry that's encased within our skulls is not sufficient to allow us to navigate through life to our best outcome. We kind of know that we need a rule book. Even you admitted that in some ways, implicitly, when you discussed the fact that we have a 25 year socialization window. And what that means is that we have to interact with other people and our traditions in order to set us right. And that's so complex, it takes 25 years. And so we're learning something from that. And that's indication that our, let's say, default biological settings are insufficient to guide us into the future. Right. And so then the question is, well, what is it that you're learning as a consequence of that socialization process?",
