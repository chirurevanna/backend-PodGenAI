"And now for my discussion with Dr. Laurie Santos, Dr. Laurie Santos, welcome. Thanks So, so much for having me on the show. I wanna talk about this thing that everyone seems to want, but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves in a state of happiness, which raises the question of whether or not we should even be seeking to constantly be in a state of happiness. But just to sit back from that question for a moment, how should we think about the relationship between emotions and this thing that we call Cognition?
