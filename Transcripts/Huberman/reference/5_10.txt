"Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Dr. Becky Kennedy. Dr. Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist and one of the world's foremost experts in parent-child relationships. Now, you may or may not have children. If you do, today's episode is absolutely for you. If you don't, well you were once a child, perhaps you're even still a child. Today's episode also will have valuable knowledge and tools that you can apply to your life today. Dr. Becky Kennedy teaches us an immense number of extremely valuable tools for the workplace, for romantic relationships, for family relationships of all types, not just parent-child relationships, and of course also for parent-child relationships. 

We discussed themes that have not been discussed previously on the Huberman Lab podcast. Topics such as Guilt, which Dr. Becky Kennedy offers a completely unique perspective on one that I've never heard before and that frankly I don't think anyone has heard before. In fact, she distinguishes between what most people think is Guilt and an entirely different set of emotions and offers you very useful practical tools for when you experience Guilt and how to work with Guilt. We also extensively discuss Frustration or what she calls Frustration Tolerance. Frustration Tolerance is an extremely important theme for everybody to understand and apply in their lives because Frustration Tolerance, as Dr. Becky Kennedy so aptly points out, is central to the learning process of anything at every age. 

If you can understand this concept and you apply some of the very simple rules and tools that Dr. Kennedy explains during the podcast, I assure you you can learn many more things much more quickly and with much greater satisfaction if not during the process. Certainly at the end when you master that learning. And those are just a few of the themes that we discussed during today's episode. Again, whether or not you have children, I assure you that today's episode is going to be immensely beneficial for all of your relationships. You will notice during today's episode that our studio backdrop is different. You will notice that for once I was not wearing this particular style of shirt. The reason for That is that this episode was recorded during the LA Fires what was initially called the Palisades Fire and then spread to multiple fires throughout LA County. 

So we were not able to access our normal studio. So I want to express extreme gratitude to Rich Roll, our good friend in the podcasting space who allowed us to use his podcast studio, which is where I'm seated now, and where I held the discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy. First off, our entire team, our homes and our studio are fine. I can assure you of that. But most importantly, our thoughts and our prayers go out to the people who have lost their homes, lost pets, and sadly there have been fatalities during the LA Fires. So our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and we hope everyone remains safe. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 

It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme. Today's episode does include Sponsors. And now for my discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy, Dr. Becky Kennedy, welcome back. I'm so happy to be here. Grateful to Rich Roll for lending us his studio under the duress of fires in Los Angeles. I'm praying that his home is okay. It's unclear at this moment, but in any event, let's talk about emotions, both theory and practice, and if we can place it in the context of Parenting, that would be great. 

But I'm certain that this has a broader theme that pertains to everybody. So I love the theory of emotions or how we would theoretically respond to something, but then there's the reality. But as a parent, let's say you have a stance in your home and in your family that it's okay to be sad. Like sadness is normal, it happens, it passes, et cetera. But let's say you are feeling particularly sad about something. Do you express that and show that in front of your kids? Because I've also heard that young kids in particular, younger than eight or nine perhaps shouldn't be aware that their parents are experiencing say, extreme sadness because it can be scary to them where they might feel like their world is destabilizing. 

And then we also hear a lot about kids feeling like they had to parent the parents and then this whole thing becomes pretty complicated. So while, yeah, there's no perfect world where one knows what to do every single time, how do you look at this business of modeling emotions and also encouraging kids to be able to experience and express their emotions? Yeah, and I think everything I'm about to share applies, you know, in the workplace, right? Like can a boss be, you know, really upset in front of the person they manage management, right? So it's all the same stuff. So I guess zooming out as a start, emotions are normal. Emotions are unstoppable. 

You can't not feel sad just because you have your 5-year-old in the room, right? And I think the other thing that kind of forms my perspective is it's really hard to not show someone that you're sad. Like you might think you're doing that well, but kids are extra perceptive. They are actually built to be more perceptive than we are because their survival depends on adults. So they have to always notice is my adult around? Is my adult okay? So they really attune to what's going on for us, right? And so I think the kind of question is less do I show my emotions to my kid or not? 

And it's more okay, if I'm sad, my kid is gonna notice. What do I do then? And as a principal, one of the things I think about often is information doesn't scare kids as much as the absence of information scares kids. So let's say there's, let's say there's something really awful. I don't know. As a parent, your your family member, someone died of cancer. I don't know, there's something really horrible that you just found out, right? There's wildfires right now. Let's say you evacuated and you found out your house burned down, you're sad. Your child is going to notice that. And you want your child to notice that you don't want your kid to be a teenager and adult who goes around the world unable to pick up on emotional cues from other people. 

That that that's not adaptive. And so the patterns we set with our kids when they're young inform their view of the world when they're older. And so here I am, let's say it's the situation of somebody dying and I'm upset, first of all, as a parent, tell yourself it's not my kid seeing me sad that's going to destabilize them. It's seeing me sad and me making up a bogus story or denying it because then my kid goes, pretty sure my mom was upset. Oh, she's not. Oh she's pretending like nothing happened. Oh she looks sad, but she's saying she's not sad. That is really upsetting. 

It would be like hearing your boss say, oh yeah, 20% layoffs. What are we doing? I don't know. Oh hi. Everything's great. How are you? Like what is happening? Scary. What you'd want is your boss say You just heard something. You were right to hear that we are about to go through a really tough time. I'm stressed about it. That's why I yelled, you might be stressed. Here's what I know. This is gonna be hard and we're gonna get through it together. Now all of a sudden that emotional experience has a container. It has a story. Humans need stories. We like stories. And so often we think it's the emotions that dysregulate a kid. 

It's the lack of a story to explain it. So let's say this really did happen. People always say to me, okay, but Dr. Becky, like my kid is four. I'm gonna say that their aunt died. They don't even know cancer. Right? We don't have a better alternative. I can't even tell you how many parents I've seen whose kids have all of these issues because of the made up stories. I just said she went to sleep for a while. Six months later, my kid has a lot of trouble sleeping through the night. Yeah, they haven't seen their aunt who went to sleep one time. Cre, you know, creates a huge issue. No matter what bogus story you make up, kids can handle the truth and they can handle the truth when it's told to them from a loving, trusted adult. It's kind of like me and you, someone can tell us a hard truth, but it's from someone you feel safe with and that you feel like also believes in you and says it. 

Honestly. It might be hard, but it doesn't feel awful. So it's about saying to your kid, you saw me crying. One of my favorite kind of sentences to say to kids around this. 'cause I think it really builds their confidence is just, you were Right to Notice that I was crying and I'm feeling sad. And look, you saw that I'm, I'm gonna tell you why I'm making this up. And Aunt Sally died. Do you know what dying means? Dying is when someone's body stops working, then I'd pause, right? This wanna just be a monologue. I'll see how my kid responds. I might add, I'm not dying. 

Kids actually really need to hear that in hard times. I'm not dying. No one else is dying. I'm safe. And you know what? I'm sad and I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you. That sets the stage for such resilience and is kind of the opposite of everything's fine. My kid keeps seeing me crying. They keep hearing words. They're not used to hearing die cancer, aunt Sally funeral, whatever it is. That"
