"And now for my discussion with Dr. Laurie Santos, Dr. Laurie Santos, welcome. Thanks So, so much for having me on the show. I wanna talk about this thing that everyone seems to want, but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves in a state of happiness, which raises the question of whether or not we should even be seeking to constantly be in a state of happiness. But just to sit back from that question for a moment, how should we think about the relationship between emotions and this thing that we call Cognition? Because I think a lot of where we're going today is to distinguish between feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. And as neuroscientists, psychologists, et cetera, we have to understand the difference between emotions and Cognition and maybe where they overlap. 
So if you could educate us a bit on that, I think that will set the stage nicely for understanding happiness. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you started there actually, because you know the very definition of happiness, I think, as social scientists tend to think about, it includes both of these parts, right? So I think social scientists tend to think about happiness as being happy in your life and being happy with your life. So being happy in your life is sort of the emotion side, right? Of decent number of positive emotions, maybe slightly less negative emotions like you existing in your life feels good. That's kind of an emotional part, right? But then there's also kind of how you think your life is going. Do you have purpose? Are you kind of happy with how things are going? It's how you think about your life, which is sort of cognitive thing. 
And so even the earliest social scientists who started thinking about happiness at the time, they call it subjective wellbeing, because I think psychologists were like, Ooh, happiness sounds, sounds too wooey. Like, we'll call it something else, but it means exactly the same thing. It means subjective wellbeing, right? When they started thinking about subjective wellbeing, they divided it into this sort of affective emotional part, which is like how you feel in your life, but also this cognitive part, how you think your life is going. So that basic dichotomy has been there since the very beginning of folks studying happiness scientifically. I'm already struck by this distinction between how things are going in your life versus with your life. One requires a, a kind of first person experiencing of life in your life. 
You know, do you wake up feeling good? Are you feeling good with your inside of your friendships and other relationships, family, romantic relationships, school work? The other involves a bit of a third person of self Yep. Of looking at one's cv, either actual CV or reflected CV through the lens of other people and kind of getting a sense like, am I doing well? Am I not doing well? I think this is a really important distinction because it seems like ultimately the goal, if I may, is to be happy in your life, regardless of the third person provided that you're not doing damage to somebody else's happiness in life. 
Yeah. Well, I think ideally it'd be nice to do both, right? And I think there are moments when these things dissociate, right? So, you know, you interact with lots of interesting rich people out here in California. I think a lot of them have in kind of in their life feels pretty good, right? They have lots of hedonic pleasures, they're drinking nice wine, hanging out. I'd be amazed, You'd be amazed how much, how much I, I'm, how much suffering they report. Oh, that's interesting. How Much suffering they report. So this is the question is is is this sort of cognitive part the like third person part, or is it the reporting part? And I think when the psychologists are thinking about it, they really think about it as the reporting part, right? And, and this gets tricky, right? Because you know, I see folks having their nice glass of wine on the beach, and I'm thinking like that's coming with lots of positive emotion. 
Like I bet if I tested them and could have a direct look at their sensory experience, it'd probably be pretty positive. It's only when they reflect on their life and they're asking, well, how's it going? That they say, oh, you know, I don't know my stocks went down. Or like When I hear about lack of happiness, let me think of some of the kind of bullet point ones that come seem to come up repetitively are they are indeed not related to lack of resources. I don't hear that. What I've heard, and this is also true for where I spend part of my time and where I grew up, which is in Silicon Valley, which is also not everyone, but there are people there who have accrued tremendous amount of wealth. The mean has shifted very high, and hence the cost of living. 
But it's often concerns about their kids. Yeah. Or their mother is ill, their child is struggling in a particular way. Very often that's what it is. They're concerned about the lack of wellbeing in their kids related to mental health or physical health or other relatives, mental health, physical health, or they're upset about something politically. Yeah. But we won't go there. We won't go there. Yeah. No, I think this is true, right? You know, so much of our happiness is made up of the happiness of other people, right? Both kind of how they're doing and how we think they're doing cognitively, but literally just emotionally, right? 
You know, if you've ever been around a family member or a spouse who was incredibly pissed off"
