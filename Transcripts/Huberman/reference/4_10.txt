"Before we get to the origins of the universe Yeah. And the organization of the Planets relative to the sun and their spins, et cetera. You said something that at least to me feels int intuitively so true, and I think it's very likely to be true for everybody, which is that there's something about looking up into space, especially at night when we see the stars and hopefully see the stars. We'll talk about light pollution a little bit later when we see the stars that yes, we know these things are far away. Yes, we know that they occupy a certain position in space. They have a, a diameter, et cetera. 

We might not know what That is, just by looking at them. You probably do, but, but they also change our perception of time. And, you know, if I were to say one thing about the human brain especially, is that, sure, it's got all these autonomic functions, it regulates heart rate, digestion, it, et cetera, sleep, wake cycles. It can remember, it can think, it can have states like rage or anger or happiness or delight. But what's remarkable about the human brain is that it can think into the past. It can be quote unquote present, and it can project into the future. And I'm sure other animals can do that. But we do this exquisitely well, and we make plans on the basis of this ability to contract or expand our notion of time as a non biologist. 

But somebody who I think appreciates and understands biology. Why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky, even though most people might not realize that those stars probably aren't there and occupying the position that we think they are, some of them are probably are, some of them aren't. They existed a long time ago. But without knowing that, why do you think that looking up at the stars gives, gives us the sense of an expansion of time Hmm. As opposed to just the expansion of space? Hmm. Well, first of all, we have to take ourselves back, you know, to deep prehistory. We know that ancients were looking at, at the Constellations, because they were seemingly either in control of, or correlated with, or perhaps causative of the Seasons. 

And that was of, you know, divine important, you know, supreme importance for them, right? Their whole existence in AG, early agrarian societies, hunting societies, gathering societies. So they had to know about time. So time, the, the essence of time, and that on large scale for Seasons, for holidays, for festivals, for propitiation of DDS and so forth, they had to keep track of it. And that's why in the caves, in Lasko that, you know, date back to the, you know, 40,000, BCE, they depict Constellations, Orion, the hunter, Taurus, the bull, all these different Constellations, they depict them there. Now, partially that was because, you know, Netflix didn't exist back then, right? There was no TikTok. And, and so there wasn't much to do at night. And in fact, the more you're out at night, you probably increased your opportunity to be, you know, consumed by some predator, right? 

So you were, you were more focused on being stationary, observing. And as I said, we can do Astronomy uniquely. So amongst all the sciences, with just the equipment, we're born with, you know, measurements with our eyes, with respect to landmarks, to ca calculate patterns. And humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns sometimes too. Good. So, for instance, knowing that a certain swath of stars is present at one time of year and not another relative to say the, the contour of a, of a mountain ridge. Yes. And, and, and the, and the repetition of it over, and it passed down through generations before there was written language, there was pictography, there was the cave paintings and so forth. There was oral language, and that was it for, you know, written language was only, you know, 10,000 years old or something like that. 

So to store information that meant it was a continuity between generations. My great-great grandfather's, elders, whatever, taught me that when the moon is in this constellation, the sun is in this constellation, we, well should plant, or we should, you know, harvest in other cons in other times. And so it was, and it, we still do use the, you know, the rotation of the earth, you know, hasn't changed that much since this 40,000 year period. Right? I mean, the, the axis in which it rotates that, that's a different story, but, but the, the actual spin rate, the angular momentum of the earth has not appreciably changed that much. And so the positions of these objects were of such importance that the ancients would use them for all these purposes. 

But there were so few things that changed position that they actually had names for them. They're called Planets. So planet in Greek, it's like the word plane, like airplane. It means something that moves or wanders. So when you name something, it means it's, it's pretty different from the other things in which are not associated with that characteristic. So the Planets, there were only five that they could, you know, see at that time up to Saturn. And they actually would associate those not only with astronomical events, but events down on earth. That's what connected the earth. So we, we have legacy of that in our calendar today. So Sunday named after the sun Monday, moon Tuesday, and you go to the Latin languages, I think it's Mercury, mercury, which is Mercury Day, ERDI Venus Day. 

So you go to the romance languages, and then the only one that's not a Latin name is of course for Thor, the God Thor Thursday. And then it comes back Saturday, day Saturday. So they were all used as a clock. And you people don't really grasp this. I mean, we have an Apple watch, we have whatever, we didn't have a clock that was functional, that would work on all different time zones in all different conditions on the pitching deck of a ship till the 17 hundreds. Basically. It was a huge problem. And so measuring time became crucial for commerce, for, you know, human culture and civilization to arise for education, and obviously for planting, harvesting and so forth. So there was an obvious connection between the two. 

They believed actually, that there were causative, that actually the position of the planet, Jupiter determined something on the day of your birth and the son's relative position with respect to it determined something about your, your, your future and your, and your, you know, prospects in life and, and so forth. So when I'm not confused for a cosmetologist, you know, 'cause of my lovely hair and makeup, I'm usually asked, you know, oh, you're an astronomer, I'm a Virgo, you know, so what's gonna happen to me? I'm like, oh, I used to be, oh, okay, that's an astrologer. I'm not an astrologer. But now I just, I kind of lean into it. I'm like, Ooh, that you're gonna get a letter from the IRSS next week. And that lump on your ass, that's You. That's, you mean, you mean you, you're, you're playing games with them. Yeah. So you, you don't believe in Astrology. 

There's no evidence for Astrology. In fact, there's, there's, you know, many, many random controlled, you know, trials Sure. Double bun study that showed, not only is it, it's almost counter to the evidence, you know, like, and they say that a monkey can throw a dart at a stock chart and get, you know, do better than most hedge fund managers or something like that. Actually, astrologers are even worse. Like, I don't even know. A, a protozoa could throw a dart. Yeah. It's, it's almost anti-correlated, you know, with, with what reality is. So, no, there's certainly no validity to that. And I, I had a, you know, provocative tweet, you know, whatever post recently, and it was about, there's actually thir, you know, we believe there are 12 zodiac cons, you know, signs. 

And that dates back to the Persians and the Babylonians and how they divided up them. And it almost divides, you know, they were fascinated with the number 60. So that, that was the base of their number system. Our number system is 10. 'cause we have 10 figure, for some reason they love Base 60. I don't know why. And so they love things that divide it evenly into it. 10 does. But anyway, you know, hashtag fail for the, for the Babylonians, but they divided it up into 12, 12 zodiac signs. So we still use those. There's a problem, though, the zodiac, that you're, do you know what this is? Do you know what determines your zodiac side? No. Oh, okay. So it's determined by the position of the sun. What constellation was the sun in on the day you were born? 

September 26th. So when the, that means that the sun was in the constellation. Virgo. Oh no, you were a Libra, Libra, Libra. Okay. So you do know what you are, but you don't know why you are. So, Libra means it's a constellation. There's 88 Constellations that are accepted by astronomers, and the one of them is Libra. And the path that the sun and the moon and all the Planets travel, and it's called the zodiac. It's confined to a plane because the same proto pro proto solar system disc from which we formed out of all the Planets, came out of a nebula cloud, a cloud of gas, dust, rocks, and so forth, that came from a preexisting star that exploded creating what's called a supernova. 

The supernova provided the materials to make not only the earth, but the entire solar system, including the sun that happened about 5 billion years ago, and 4 billion years ago, the earth formed out of that cloud, that the spin of that disc, all things have a spin associated with them. Like a figure skater, you know, she's spinning around on her axis or whatever, she can have her arms out, brings them in, she spins faster. That's called conservation of angular momentum. Spin is a type of angular momentum. The whole disc is spinning in a plane. It's like this desk, this table that we're sitting at. If you listening, you imagine a flat table, it's spinning, A circular disc is spinning with a certain direction. All the objects are moving in that same direction due to conservation of this term called angular momentum. 

The sun moves in that apparently moves in that position. Obviously we're rotating around the sun, but it looks like the sun's coming around us. The moon is Jupiter. So in the day you were born, there's a constellation behind the sun from our perspective, that was Libra on September 26th, and that was the day that you were born. That determines the fact that you're a Libra. But there's a problem in December where we are now, the sun is actually in a different constellation. The one that doesn't exist, according to the Zodiac that was created something like six thou 5,000 years ago, it's called phe. So there's a certain segment of people born in a 17 day stretch in December, late November to early December that are actually Phe yuin or cus or whatever. 

So that should obliterate Astrology as any semblance of a science, because they didn't even know this constellation existed. And yet, something like 12% of all people"
