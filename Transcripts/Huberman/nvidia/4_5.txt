  "transcription": "before we get to the origins of the universe and the organization of the planets relative to the sun and their spins etc you said something that at least to me feels intuitively so true and i think it's very likely to be true for everybody which is that there's something about looking up into space especially at night when we see the stars and hopefully see the stars we'll talk about light pollution a little bit later when we see the stars that yes we know these things are far away yes we know that they occupy a certain position in space they have a diameter et cetera we might not know what that is just by looking at them you probably do but they also change our perception of time and you know if i were to say one thing about the human brain especially is that sure it's got all these autonomic functions it regulates heart rate digestion et cetera sleep wake cycles it can remember it can think it can have states like rage or anger or happiness or delight but what's remarkable about the human brain is that it can think into the past it can be quote unquote present and it can project into the future and i'm sure other animals can do that but we do this exquisitely well and we make plans on the basis of this ability to contract or expand our notion of time as a non biologist but somebody who i think appreciates and understands biology why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky even though most people might not realize that those stars probably aren't there and occupying the position that we think they are some of them probably are some of them aren't they existed a long time ago but without knowing that why do you think that looking up at the stars gives gives us the sense of an expansion of time as opposed to just the expansion of space well first of all we have to take ourselves back you know to deep prehistory we know that ancients were looking at at the constellations because they were seemingly either in control of or correlated with or perhaps causative of the seasons and that was of divine importance supreme importance for them right their whole existence in early agrarian societies hunting societies gathering societies so they had to know about time so time the essence of time and that on large scale for seasons for holidays for festivals for propitial of deities and so forth they had to keep track of it and that's why in the caves in laska that you know date back to the you know forty thousand b c e they depict constellations orion the hunter taurus the bull all these different constellations they depict them there now partially that was because you know netflix didn't exist back then right there was no tick tock and and so there wasn't much to do at night and in fact the more you're out at night you probably increased your opportunity to be you know consumed by some predator right so you were more focused on being stable stationary observing and as i said we can do astronomy uniquely so amongst all the sciences with just the equipment we're born with you know measurements with our eyes with respect to landmarks to cat calculate patterns and humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns sometimes too good so for instance knowing that a certain swath of stars is present at one time of year and not another relative to say the contour of a mountain ridge yes and the and the repetition of it over and passed down through generations before there was written language there was pictography there was these cave paintings and so forth there was oral language and that was it for you know written language is only you know ten thousand years old or something like that so to store information that meant it was a continuity between generations my great great great grandfather's elders whatever taught me that when the moon is in this constellation the sun is in this constellation we should plant or we should you know harvest in other constant in other times and so it was and we still do use the you know the rotation of the earth you know hasn't changed that much since this forty thousand year period right i mean the axis in which it rotates that that's a different story but but the actual spin rate the angular momentum of the earth has not appreciably changed that much and so the positions of these objects were of such importance that the ancients would use them for all these purposes but there were so few things that changed position that they actually had names for them they're called planets so planet in greek it's like the word plane like airplane it means something that moves or wanders so when you name something it means it's pretty different from the other things in which are not associated with that characteristic so the planets there are only five that they could you know see at that time up to saturn and they actually would associate those not only with astronomical events but events down on earth that's what connected the earth so we have legacy of that in our calendar today so sunday named after the sun monday moon tuesday and you go to the latin languages i think it's mercury which is",
