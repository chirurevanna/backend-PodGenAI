  "transcription": "welcome to the huberman lab podcast where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life i'm andrew huberman and i'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at stanford school of medicine my guest today is josh waitskin josh waitskin is a former child prodigy who began playing the game of chess at six years old and by the time he was sixteen years old had become a national champion many times over as well as an international champion in fact he achieved the level of international master which is one of the highest levels of achievement in the game of chess for anyone of any age his early life achievements were the topic and focus of the book and movie searching for bobby fisher he then quit playing the game of chess and moved on to martial arts the study of philosophy at columbia university in new york and eventually foiling which is essentially surfing over the water josh is not only a high performer he has now become perhaps the most sought after professional coach in the domains of finance in the domains of creative endeavors professional sports and military today's episode is one of my favorite huberman lab podcast episodes ever i know as a podcast host you're not supposed to say that but it's absolutely true because not only is josh waits can so highly accomplished but he is an exceptional teacher of the learning process he took what he learned in chess and about learning chess and applied that to martial arts to foiling etc and from participating in all those endeavors he was able to distill out the essential elements of learning and how to tailor one's learning process to one's own unique personality and style flaws and tendency to make mistakes and how to leverage all of that in order to be able to learn better in fact throughout today's episode i promise that you will constantly be reflecting on where you experience things like tension and fear both in your personal life your professional life your educational life whatever it is that you're trying to learn and pursue in life today's conversation thanks to josh will allow you to look at that understand it better and know where to apply work when to relax when to push forward and in effect how to become a better learner both of yourself and whatever it is that you happen to be pursuing in life we have a saying in science which is that sometimes you encounter somebody who is truly n of one meaning a sample size of one in a category all by themselves josh wait skin is truly and of one i know of no other person like him or even close to him in terms of his ability to live a unique life path and to take what he learns and to put it out into the world so that others may benefit he lives with a tremendous amount of intentionality for the people he loves for the things he loves and with the intention of helping others learn how to learn better i must say it was a true honor to sit down with josh i've been a huge fan of his work for a very long time you'll also learn that he a really nice person before we begin i'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme this podcast episode does include sponsors and now for my discussion with josh waitskin josh waitskin welcome thank you man great to be here i feel like i've known you a long time because i saw the search for bobby fisher and i learned about the real human that was about you and i read the art of learning and i must say i'm a fan and somewhat obsessed with the uniqueness of your arc and the choices you've made and your understanding of learning as a process and its universal properties its specific properties in different contexts so i'm excited to dive in i think for people that perhaps are not familiar with you maybe you could just give us a broad overview view of your backstory like the things that you've really focused on in kind of chunks if you will just for a couple of minutes so that people can get familiar with the incredible things you've done and i think that reflects the uniqueness of your choice making process which then we'll get into yeah sure well thank you man it's an honor i appreciate what you said yes i started playing chess i grew up in new york city downtown manhattan i started playing chess when i was six years old and and i discovered chess walking through washington square park with my mom and i remember watching a day or two and then at one point i broke away from her i was going to play on monkey bars and i ran over and i asked an old man if i could play and he said yes and my mom was surprised and we started playing i played my first game of chess and i remember the very distinct feeling of it was as if i was just discovering or rediscovering a lost memory it wasn't like i was learning something new it was like i was wiping away the dust of the cobwebs between something between me and something i had known very deeply at one very strange feeling for a six year old boy and i just fell in love with the game i got really intensely into it my first teachers were the hustlers in washington square so it's like a raucous crowd of guys who took me under their wing started teaching me the tactical street side of the game and i was just unhindered as a learner which is interesting from my perspective now as a dad because that my my little boy charlie is taking on surfing with that same kind of freedom just that liberated uncomplicated out of his own way kind of vibe yeah and then by the time i was seven i started competing and then i was a top rated player for my age in the country from my for most of the years from age seven to twenty three my whole chess career so it was a very strange upbringing in some ways which has led to some quirky elements in my psychology which was that i was living in a pressure cooker of competition from age six on and my whole childhood was spent was spent as the target and so like if you're if you're competing in national championships and you know i would compete in in youth national world championships and otherwise i'd be kim competing against adults everything else but then you're the target so any mistake you make and kids make mistakes all the time we all do my rivals and their coaches who are strong masters and international masters and grand masters would be able to study in adult strong players can see very easily the weaknesses in a child and so they would be prepared for them so if i didn't take on a weakness it would be exploited and i would experience pain and so from a very young age not taking on my weaknesses became outside of was outside of my conceptual scheme which is a really interesting thing to grow up with and it's in many ways like lay the foundation for a lot of what i've done since and there are lots of things about that upbringing which could be unhealthy i think in the public eye yes a very bizarre luckily it was before social media yeah super yeah i i've never been on social media in any way which has been a choice yes when i was eleven the book searching for robbie fisher came out and when i was fifteen the movie came out and at that point i was you know completely in love with chess it was my first love i was an unobstructed learner i was love competition a lot of my opponents were trying to control the game memorize openings figure out how to win by force but i love the battle my style was to create chaos like like in washington square park find hidden harmonies and chaos and i love that so as game went on and they moved away from their opening preparation and controlling things we moved into my power zone which was the fight i love the fight and then my chess life in many ways was was free flowing and then the movie came out when i was fifteen and then you can imagine what that was like as as you know a young teenager all the attention the media cameras everywhere groupies all the temptations and i didn't ask for it and it was a really it was an alienating period for me relative to chess and around the same time i started training with a russian chess trainer who started urging me to move away from my self expression as a chess player and to study the players who were the opposite of me i was an attacking player aggressive i played kind of in the style not at the level but in the style of like bobby fischer or gary kasparov or mikhail tall world champions who were like hot blooded and i was being urged to study the more cold blooded prophylactic side of chess petrozan karpov more conservative defensive players so i was being told instead of saying like what what does josh feel here what would karpov play here who's the opposite of me and so the combination of that public eye and then the movement away from my self expression led to a period of obstructedness and self consciousness and what interesting theme we could talk about at one point is that passage from a preconscious to a post conscious competitor in many ways i went from like that freedom of preconscious competition into the tunnel of existential crisis and i grappled with it for a lot years and when i was eighteen when i graduated high school i and during that grappling i was still the top rated player in the country i was winning the national championships every year so like from the outside it looked good but from the inside i was in turmoil i was fighting with myself i had all these demons and then i left the u s i spent a number of years after high school studying east asian philosophy meditating reflecting and then my study of chess in those years and i was deeply in love with chess still it became much more of an introspective process became i was competing as intensely as ever but chess became connected to life and then when i was nineteen years old i started training at the human performance institute at the time it was called l g e layer grappling at your bar and it's a very it was a it was a performance training cross disciplinary performance training center that jim lehre opened up and now then i became the h b i later on and i never forget the moment that i was i was working with these performance psychologists and i was and i was at the gym and i was working",
