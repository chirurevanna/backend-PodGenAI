  "transcription": "and now for my discussion with dr jordan peterson dr jordan peterson welcome thank you sir delighted to have you here and want to talk about elements within your new book yeah also some elements within your previous books and within that mind of yours generally as a framework for that i'm wondering if you would tolerate or permit a little bit of a discussion about brain and psychology just kind of lay the groundwork for we might prod some of the themes that you bring up related to the book so i view the brain as obviously a bunch of cells and parts et cetera but i distill it down to some basic features first of all we have an autonomic physiology i think we'd both agree on that that regulates our sleepiness and wakefulness our breathing our heart rate stuff that runs in the background and then we have a lot of circuitry devoted to what i would call impulses things that we desire we want to move toward",
