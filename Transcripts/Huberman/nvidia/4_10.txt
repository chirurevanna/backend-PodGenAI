  "transcription": "before we get to the origins of the universe and the organization of the planets relative to the sun and their spins etc you said something that at least to me feels intuitively so true and i think it's very likely to be true for everybody which is that there's something about looking up into space especially at night when we see the stars and hopefully see the stars we'll talk about light pollution a little bit later when we see the stars that yes we know these things are far away yes we know that they occupy a certain position in space they have a diameter et cetera we might not know what that is just by looking at them you probably do but they also change our perception of time and you know if i were to say one thing about the human brain especially is that sure it's got all these autonomic functions it regulates heart rate digestion et cetera sleep wake cycles it can remember it can think it can have states like rage or anger or happiness or delight but what's remarkable about the human brain is that it can think into the past it can be quote unquote present and it can project into the future and i'm sure other animals can do that but we do this exquisitely well and we make plans on the basis of this ability to contract or expand our notion of time as a non biologist but somebody who i think appreciates and understands biology why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky even though most people might not realize that those stars probably aren't there and occupying the position that we think they are some of them probably are some of them aren't they existed a long time ago but without knowing that why do you think that looking up at the stars gives gives us the sense of an expansion of time as opposed to just the expansion of space well first of all we have to take ourselves back you know to deep prehistory we know that ancients were looking at at the constellations because they were seemingly either in control of or correlated with or perhaps causative of the seasons and that was of divine importance supreme importance for them right their whole existence in early agrarian societies hunting societies gathering societies so they had to know about time so time the essence of time and that on large scale for seasons for holidays for festivals for propitial of deities and so forth they had to keep track of it and that's why in the caves in lasco that you know date back to the you know forty thousand b c e they depict constellations orion the hunter taurus the bull all these different constellations they depict them there now partially that was because you know netflix didn't exist back then right there was no tick tok and and so there wasn't much to do at night and in fact the more you're out at night you probably increased your opportunity to be you know consumed by some predator right so you were more focused on being stable stationary observing and as i said we can do astronomy uniquely so amongst all the sciences with just the equipment we're born with you know measurements with our eyes with respect to landmarks to cat calculate patterns and humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns sometimes too good so for instance knowing that a certain swath of stars is present at one time of year and not another relative to say the contour of a mountain ridge yes and the and the repetition of it over and passed down through generations before there was written language there was pictography there was these cave paintings and so forth there was oral language and that was it for you know written language is only you know ten thousand years old or something like that so to store information that meant it was a continuity between generations my great great great grandfather's elders whatever taught me that when the moon is in this constellation the sun is in this constellation we should plant or we should you know harvest in other constant in other times and so it was and we still do use the you know the rotation of the earth you know hasn't changed that much since this forty thousand year period right i mean the axis in which it rotates that that's a different story but but the actual spin rate the angular momentum of the earth has not appreciably changed that much and so the positions of these objects were of such importance that the ancients would use them for all these purposes but there were so few things that changed position that they actually had names for them they're called planets so planet in greek it's like the word plane like airplane it means something that moves or wanders so when you name something it means it's pretty different from the other things in which are not associated with that characteristic so the planets there are only five that they could you know see at that time up to saturn and they actually would associate those not only with astronomical events but events down on earth that's what connected the earth so we have legacy of that in our calendar today so sunday named after the sun monday moon tuesday and you go to the latin languages i think it's mercury which is mercury day vantra davin venus day city go to romance languages and then the only one that's not a latin name is of course for for the god for thursday and then comes back saturn day saturday so they were all used as a clock and you people don't really grasp this i mean we have an apple watch we have whatever we didn't have a clock that was functional that would work on all different time zones in all different conditions on the pitching deck of a ship till the seventeen hundreds basically it was a huge problem and so measuring time became crucial for commerce for you know human culture and civilization to arise for education and obviously for planting harvesting and so forth so there was an obvious connection between the two they believed actually that they were causative that actually the position of the planet jupiter determined something on the day of your birth and the sun's relative position with respect to it determined something about your future and your and your prospects in life and so forth so when i i'm not confused for a cosmetologist because my lovely hair and makeup i'm usually asked you know oh you're an astronomer i'm a virgo you know so what's going to happen to me i'm like i used to be ok that's an astrologer i'm not astrology but now i just lean into it i'm like who that you're going to get a letter from the i r s next week and that lump on your ass you mean you and you're playing games with him yes you don't believe in astrology there's no evidence for astrology in fact there's you know many many random controlled you know trials or double study that showed not only is it it's almost counter to the evidence you know like they say that a monkey can throw a dart at a stock chart and get you know do better than most hedge fund managers or something like actually astrologers are even worse like i don't even know protozoa can throw a dart you know it's almost anti correlated with with what reality is so no there's certainly no the validity to that and i had you know provocative tweet you know whatever post recently and it was about there's actually you know we believe there are twelve zodiac signs and that dates back to the persians and the babylonians and how they divided up them and it almost divides you know they were fascinated with the number sixty so that that was the base of their number system our number system is ten because we have ten figures for some reason they love base sixty i don't know why and so they love things that divide it evenly into it ten does but anyway you know hashtag fail for the for the babylonians but they divided it up into twelve twelve zodiac signs so we still use those there's a problem though the zodiac that you're do you know what this is do you know what determines your zodiac sign no ok so it's determined by the position of the sun what constellation was the sun in on the day you were born september twenty sixth so when the that means that the sun was in the constellation virgo or no you were a libra libra you do know what you are but you know why you are so libra means as a constellation there's eighty eight constellations that are accepted by astronomers and the one of them is libra and the path that the sun and the moon and all the planets travel in is called the zodiac it's confined to a plane because the same proto planet proto solar system disk from which we formed out of all the planets came out of a nebular cloud a cloud of gas dust rocks and so forth that came from a preexisting star that exploded creating what's called a supernova the supernova provided the materials to make not only the earth but the entire solar system including the sun that happened about five billion years ago and four billion years ago the earth formed out of that cloud that the spin of that disk all things have a spin associated with them like a figure skater you know she's spinning around on her axis or whatever she can have her arms out brings them and she spins faster that's called conservation of angular momentum spin is a type of angular momentum the whole disk is spinning in a plane it's like this desk this table that we're sitting at if you're listening you imagine a flat table it's spinning a circular is spinning with a certain direction all the objects are moving in that same direction due to conservation of this term called angular momentum the sun moves in that apparently moves in that position obviously we're rotating around the sun but it looks like the sun's coming around us the moon is jupiter so on the day you were born there's a constellation behind the sun from our perspective that was libra on september twenty sixth and that was the day that you were born that determines the fact that you're a libra but there's a problem in december where we are now the sun is actually in a different constellation the one that doesn't exist according to the zodiac that was created something like six five thousand years ago it's called ophiuchus so there's a certain segment of people born in a seventeen day stretch in december late november to early december that are actually ophiuchans or ophiuchuses or whatever so that should obliterate astrology as any semblance of a science because they didn't even know this constellation existed and yet something like twelve percent of all people share",
