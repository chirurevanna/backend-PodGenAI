  "transcription": "and now for my discussion with dr laurie santos dr laurie santos welcome thanks so so much for having me on the show i want to talk about this thing that everyone seems to want but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves in a state of happiness which raises the question of whether or not we should even be seeking to constantly be in a state of happiness but just to sit back from that question for a moment how should we think about the relationship between emotion emotions and this thing that we call cognition because i think a lot of where we're going today is to distinguish between feelings thoughts and behaviors and as neuroscientists psychologists etc we have to understand the difference between emotions and cognition and maybe where they overlap so if you could educate us a bit on that i think that will set the stage nicely for understanding happiness yeah well i'm glad you started there actually because you know the very definition of happiness i think a social tend to think about it includes both of these parts right so i think social scientists tend to think about happiness as being happy in your life and being happy with your life so being happy in your life is sort of the emotion side right a decent number of positive emotions maybe slightly less negative emotions like you existing in your life feels good that's kind of an emotional part right but then there's also kind of how you think your life is going do you have purpose are you kind of happy with how things are going it's how you think about your life which is sort of a cognitive thing and so even even the earliest social scientists who started thinking about happiness at the time they call it subjective well being so i think psychologists were like oh happiness sounds too wooey like we'll call it something else but it means exactly the same thing it means subjective well being right when they started thinking about subjective well being they divided it into this sort of affective emotional part which is like how you feel in your life but also this cognitive part how you think your life is going so that basic dichotomy has been there since the very beginning of folks studying happiness scientifically i'm already struck by this distinction between how things are going in your life versus with your life one requires a kind of first person experiencing of life in your life you know you wake up feeling good are you feeling good with your inside of your friendships and other relationships family romantic relationships school work the other involves a bit of a third personing of self yeah and looking at one's c v either actual c v or reflected c through the lens of other people and kind of getting a sense like am i doing well am i not doing well i think this is a really important distinction because it seems like ultimately the goal if i may is to be happy in your life regardless of the third personing provided that you're not doing damage to somebody else's happiness in life yeah well i think ideally it'd be nice to do both right and i think there are moments when these things dissociate right so you know you interact with lots of interesting rich people out here in california i think a lot of them have it kind of in their life feels pretty good right they have lots of heedonic pleasures they're drinking nice wine and you know you be amazed at how much much how much suffering they report that's interesting how much suffering they report so this is the question is is is this sort of cognitive part the like third person part or is it the reporting part and i think when the psychologists are thinking about it they really think about it as the reporting part right and this gets tricky right because you know i see folks having their nice glass of wine on the beach and i'm thinking like that's kind lots of positive emotion like i bet if i tested them and could have a direct look at their sensory experience it'd probably be pretty positive it's only when they reflect on their life and they're asking well how's it going that they say oh you know i don't know my stocks went down or like when i hear about lack of happiness let me think of some of the kind of bullet point ones that seem to come up repetitively they are indeed not related to lack of resources i don't hear that what i've heard and this is also true for where i spend part of my time in where i grew up which is in silicon valley which is also not everyone but there are people there who have accrued tremendous amount of wealth the mean has shifted very high and hence the cost of living but it's often concerns about their kids yeah or their mother is ill their child is struggling in a particular way very often that's what it is they're concerned about the lack of well being in their kids related to mental health or physical health or other relatives' mental health physical health or they're upset about something politically but we won't go there we won't go there yeah no i think this is true right you know so much of our happiness is made up of the happiness of other people right both kind of how they're doing and how we think they're doing cognitively but literally just emotionally right you know if you've ever been around a family member or a spouse who was incredibly pissed off really",
