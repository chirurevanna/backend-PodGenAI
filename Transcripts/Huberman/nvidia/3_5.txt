  "transcription": "and now for my discussion with dr jordan peterson dr jordan peterson welcome thank you sir delighted to have you here and want to talk about elements within your new book yeah also some elements within your previous books and within that mind of yours generally as a framework for that i'm wondering if you would tolerate or permit a little bit of a discussion about brain and psychology just kind of lay the groundwork for we might prod some of the themes that you bring up related to the book so i view the brain as obviously a bunch of cells and parts et cetera but i distill it down to some basic features first of all we have an autonomic physiology i think we'd both agree on that that regulates our sleepiness and wakefulness our breathing our heart rate stuff that runs in the background and then we have a lot of circuitry devoted to what i would call impulses things that we desire we want to move toward appetitive behaviors and we also have some impulses to avoid things that are putrid painful etc that's all in there like it is in other issues talk about the idea of impulse in nationship to that characterization ok because there's an important there's important point to be made on there you pay a price for characterizing that as impulse and i'd like to explore that with you because it's crucial great we'll circle back to impulse i'd like to do that and then we have a lot of circuitry people will hear about it as executive function prefrontal circuitry which does many things but i like to think of as a circuit that can say and here i'm borrowing from a previous guest who's a neurosurgeon it can say short or exert what's called top down suppression on these what i'm calling impulses it can we should talk about that to this compression idea and the inhibition idea in general great because there's i think there's a parallel problem there to the notion of impulse that's very much worth delving into great so circuitry that's devoted to our ability to self inhibit the desire to reach for something or to avoid something we can push ourselves into things that would otherwise be aversive we can avoid doing things that would otherwise drive us to quote unquote just do it anyway and then we have what i think of as our default settings kind of how we're operating in the world with respect to food other people ourselves our thoughts if we don't intervene with ourselves and these default settings are of course established by both nature a genetic program that wires up circuitry but also nurture because of the immense neuroplasticity that occurs in the first twenty five years plus of life but especially those first years of life and then of course we have neuroplasticity this incredible gift that humans have more of than any other species as far as we know which is we can decide to make changes now the reason i lay out this framework as opposed to starting with a question is because there are so many amazing questions that you ask in this book you know we who wrestle with god i've been trying to wrap our arms and minds around this huge set of questions and it occurred to me just step back from all of that and ask is part of the reason that we have a concept of god that there are multiple religions is that the consequence of some humans at some point realizing or perhaps god himself realizing that what we are equipped with as humans which we just described is insufficient to allow us to evolve as a species and be the best version of ourselves i think this for me really is like the central question of at least my life which is to what extent do i need to intervene with my default settings rewire them engage that prefrontal cortex and you know push down on some appetitive or aversive behaviors and to what extent can we do that and to what end and to what end and maybe we need a rule book you know i i am starting to believe and i'm now forty nine years old that we need a rule book that the neural circuitry that's encased within our skulls is not sufficient to allow us to navigate through life well to our best outcome we kind of know that we need a rule book even you admitted that in some ways implicitly when you discussed the fact that we have a twenty five year socialization window and what that means is that we have to interact with other people and our traditions in order to set us right and that's so complex it takes twenty five years and so we're learning something from that and that's indication that our let's say default biological settings are insufficient to guide us into the future right and so then the question is well what is it that you're learning as a consequence of that socialization process",
