  "transcription": " And now for my discussion with Dr. Laurie Santos. Dr. Laurie Santos, welcome. Thanks so much for having me on the show. I want to talk about this thing that everyone seems to want, but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves in a state of happiness, which raises the question of whether or not we should even be seeking to constantly be in a state of happiness. But just to sit back from that question for a moment, how should we think about the relationship between emotions and this thing that we call cognition? Because I think a lot of where we're going today is to distinguish between feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. And as neuroscientists, psychologists, et cetera, we have to understand the difference between emotions and cognition and maybe where they overlap. So if you could educate us a bit on that, I think that will set the stage nicely for understanding happiness. Yeah, well, I'm glad you started there actually, because the very definition of happiness, I think, as social scientists tend to think about it includes both of these parts, right? So I think social scientists tend to think about happiness as being happy in your life and being happy with your life. So being happy in your life is sort of the emotion side, right? I have a decent number of positive emotions, maybe slightly less negative emotions. Like you existing in your life feels good. That's kind of an emotional part, right? But then there's also kind of how you think your life is going. Do you have purpose? Are you kind of happy with how things are going? It's how you think about your life, which is sort of a cognitive thing. And so even the earliest social scientists who started thinking about happiness, at the time they call it subjective well-being, because I think psychologists were like, ooh, happiness sounds too wooey. Like, we'll call it something else. But it means exactly the same thing. It means subjective well-being, right? When they started thinking about subjective well-being, they divided it into this sort of affective, emotional part, which is like how you feel in your life, but also this cognitive part, how you think your life is going. So that basic dichotomy has been there since the very beginning of folks studying happiness scientifically. I'm already struck by this distinction between how things are going in your life versus with your life. One requires a kind of first person experiencing of life in your life. Do you wake up feeling good? Are you feeling good with your inside of your friendships and other relationships, family, romantic relationships, school, work? The other involves a bit of a third personing of self. I'm looking at one's CV, either actual CV or reflected CV through the lens of other people and kind of getting a sense like, am I doing well? Am I not doing well? I think this is a really important distinction because it seems like ultimately the goal, if I may, is to be happy in your life, regardless of the third personing, provided that you're not doing damage to somebody else's happiness in life. Yeah. Well, I think ideally it'd be nice to do both, right? And I think there are moments when these things dissociate, right? So, you know, you interact with lots of interesting rich people out here in California. I think a lot of them have, kind of in their life feels pretty good, right? They have lots of hedonic pleasures, they're drinking nice wine, hanging out. You'd be amazed how much suffering they report. Oh, that's interesting. How much suffering they report. So this is the question is, is this sort of cognitive part the like third person part or is it the reporting part? And I think when the psychologists are thinking about it, they really think about it as the reporting part, right? And this gets tricky, right? Because I see folks having their nice glass of wine on the beach and I'm thinking like, that's coming with lots of positive emotion. Like I bet if I tested them and could have a direct look at their sensory experience, it'd probably be pretty positive. It's only when they reflect on their life and they're asking, well, how's it going that they say, oh, I don't know, my stocks went down or like. When I hear about lack of happiness, let me think of some of the kind of bullet point ones that seem to come up repetitively. They are indeed not related to lack of resources. I don't hear that. What I've heard, and this is also true for where I spend part of my time and where I grew up, which is in Silicon Valley, which is also not everyone, but there are people there who have accrued tremendous amount of wealth. The mean has shifted very high and hence the cost of living. But it's often concerns about their kids. Or their mother is ill. Their child is struggling in a particular way. Very often that's what it is. They're concerned about the lack of well-being in their kids related to mental health or physical health or other relatives, mental health, physical health, or they're upset about something politically. But we won't go there. Yeah, no, I think this is true, right? You know, so much of our happiness is made up of the happiness of other people, right? Both kind of how they're doing and how we think they're doing cognitively, but literally just emotionally, right? You know, if you've ever been around a family member or a spouse who was incredibly pissed off, really sad, it's incredibly hard not to catch those emotions yourself. And we as psychologists know how these processes work, right? These processes are emotional contagion, where you're literally catching the emotions of other people. And so oftentimes the things that you most worry about to be happy yourself is focusing on the happiness of the people around you, because that literally becomes your happiness at a very fundamental level. Now I'm pausing just to think about this a little bit more. As grow up and I realize it varies by place and lots of circumstances, but as we grow up, we are taught to pay attention to how our life is going a bit from the outside. We gain evaluations starting really young, little stars on our pictures or good job or nowadays they say great effort in drawing. This whole thing, the growth mindset language. But I don't know that in the United States we are taught to think about being happy in our life. Right? As kids, I think all kids, mammals seem to gravitate towards Joyful experiences for them playing almost always an innate Joyful experience, but then as the evaluations start coming in we get better and better at assessing our performance and where we are Relative to the sort of standard goals of the third grade the fifth grade the grade. But at the same time, I don't think anyone ever sat me down and said, how are you going to evaluate if you're feeling good in your life? Like that you're savoring your soccer game, that you're savoring your time with friends. That was never, never taught to me. Yeah. And I think there's a real danger of these kind of extrinsic rewards, as you might call them, all the stuff outside the grades, the performance measures and so on, literally stealing your intrinsic rewards. There's this funny phenomenon in psychology where if you have something that's intrinsically rewarding, so let's say exercise, right? Like I want to go out and run like a bunch. I love running. I get this intrinsic reward from running. Now I get some sort of tool, whether it's my watch or something I'm scribbling down in a phone app, and I have to, like, log my running. Now it becomes a sort of extrinsic reward. It's not just, like, the feeling of running, but it sort of takes on this extrinsic idea. And then what happens is sometimes we end up going for that reward anyway. The fiction writer David Sedaris has this wonderful article called The Fitbit Life where he talks about how he wanted to get fit. It's an intrinsic reward of exercising more. And he got the Fitbit and then it was all about the Fitbit. And he would set the level higher and set the level higher. And he himself was miserable and no longer enjoying running to the point that like at some point he just would walk around shaking his arm just to his arm just to get up to those final steps, right? That's a really terrible case where your extrinsic reward winds up taking over. But so many of the cases you just talked about are ones in our real life where that comes up much more insidiously than with like a Fitbit or something like that. You talked about play in mammals, the easiest thing that little kid animals do all over the place. Little kid humans don't do that as much anymore because even from really young ages, they're in toddler university where they're kind of learning things to get into the next grade and get the perfect grades so they can get into institutions like ours, right? It all becomes about extrinsic rewards. And so I think you're really right. We're kind of extrinsic sizing all the rewards to the point that we're not getting to internal happiness. It was hard already to pay attention to that stuff because I think we'll probably talk about this. It's hard to be mindful about your emotions. You really have to pay attention to what's going on. But I think it's gotten even harder because we have these metrics. They're all over the place in our culture, but they're just not the intrinsic thing. There's some extrinsic marker that could make the intrinsic thing even less fun. For people that grow up or live in areas where, well, let's just say that have less disposable wealth. Is there, there must be data on sort of relationship to intrinsic versus extrinsic forces on happiness. I mean, I can make up all sorts of stories in my head about how people starting out from very different circumstances would be more or less happy. But what are the data say? Yeah. So these effects of kind of resources on happiness are really interesting and they're nuanced, right? So if you look at the lower end of the kind of income spectrum, you would obviously say that money affects happiness, right? If you can't put food on the table, if you can't put a roof over your head, definitely getting a little bit more is going to affect your happiness in a positive way. And the data sort of bear this out. There's a very famous study by the Nobel Prize winning economist, Danny Kahneman, RIP. Back in 2010, he did this cool study where he looked at the correlation between income and happiness as reported in how much stress you have, how much positive emotion you experience, and so on. At the low end of the income scales, it just goes up and up and up, right? More money just almost linearly gives you more happiness. But what Danny found is the second part of this nuanced picture.",
