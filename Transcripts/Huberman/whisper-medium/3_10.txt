  "transcription": " And now for my discussion with Dr. Jordan Peterson. Dr. Jordan Peterson, welcome. Thank you, sir. Delighted to have you here and want to talk about elements within your new book. Yeah. Also some elements within your previous books and within that mind of yours generally. As a framework for that, I'm wondering if you would tolerate or permit a little bit of a discussion about sort of brain and psychology. Just kind of lay the groundwork for where we might prod some of the themes that you bring up related to the book. So I view the brain as obviously a bunch of cells and parts, et cetera, but I distill it down to some basic features. First of all, we have an autonomic physiology. I think we'd both agree on that, that regulates our sleepiness and wakefulness, our breathing, our heart rate, stuff that runs in the background. And then we have a lot of circuitry devoted to what I would call impulses, things that we desire, we want to move toward, appetitive behaviors. And we also have some impulses to avoid things that are putrid, painful, et cetera. That's all in there like it is in other areas. We should talk about the idea of impulse in relationship to that characterization Okay, because there's an important there's an important point to be made on the There you pay a price for characterizing that as impulse and and I'd like to explore that with you because it's crucial Great. Well circle, circle blacked impulse. I'd like to do that. And then we have a lot of circuitry. People will hear about it as executive function, prefrontal circuitry, which does many things. But I like to think of as a circuit that can say and hear I'm borrowing from a previous guest who's a neurosurgeon, it can say shh or exert what's called top-down suppression on these what I'm calling impulses. It can... We should talk about that too, the suppression idea and the inhibition idea in general. Great. Because there's, I think there's a parallel problem there to the notion of impulse that's very much worth delving into. Great. So circuitry that's devoted to our ability to self-inhibit the desire to reach for something or to avoid something. We can push ourselves into things that would otherwise be aversive. We can avoid doing things that would otherwise drive us to quote unquote, just do it anyway. And then we have what I think of as our default settings, kind of how we're operating in the world with respect to food, other people, ourselves, our thoughts, if we don't intervene with ourselves. And these default settings are, of course, established by both nature, a genetic program that wires up circuitry, but also nurture because of the immense neuroplasticity that occurs in the first 25 years plus of life But especially those first years of life and then of course we have neuroplasticity this incredible gift that humans have more of than any other species as far as we know which is We can decide to make changes now the reason I lay out this framework as opposed to starting with a question is because there are so many amazing questions that you ask in this book. You know, we who wrestle with God, I mean, trying to wrap our arms and minds around this huge set of questions. And it occurred to me to step back from all of that and ask, is part of the reason that we have a concept of God, that there are multiple religions. Is that the consequence of some humans at some point realizing, or perhaps God himself realizing, that what we are equipped with as humans, which we just described, is insufficient to allow us to evolve as a species and be the best version of ourselves. I think this for me really is like the central question of at least my life, which is to what extent do I need to intervene with my default settings, rewire them, engage that prefrontal cortex and push down on some repetitive or aversive behaviors. And to what extent can we do that? And to what end? And to what end? And maybe we need a rule book. I am starting to believe, and I'm now 49 years old, that we need a rule book, that the neural circuitry that's encased within our skulls is not sufficient to allow us to navigate through life to our best outcome. We kind of know that we need a rule book, even you admitted that in some ways implicitly when you discussed the fact that we have a 25-year socialization window. And what that means is that we have to interact with other people and our traditions in order to set us right. And that's so complex it takes 25 years. And so we're learning something from that. And that's indication that our, let's say, default biological settings are insufficient to guide us into the future. Right? And so then the question is, well, what is it that you're learning as a consequence of that socialization process? And you can think about it, and people have thought about it as a series of complex inhibitions of lower-order motivational states impulses, but I'm not very happy with the inhibition model because inhibition is unsophisticated socialization Integration is sophisticated socialization. So here's a way of I really learned this I think from contrasting Freud with Piaget Because Freud's model superego is really an inhibition model and Freud was a neurologist Piaget's model was very different. He thought of The properly socialized person as someone who had integrated their lower order We'll call them impulses for now into a sustainable voluntary structure that that regulated them and gave them all their proper place. That's very different than an inhibitory model. So for example, I'll give you an example from my own life. My son was quite a willful young child. Wonder where he got it from. Fair enough. And my father you know a formidable character and so my son liked to do what he liked to do and It took him it took him quite a bit of tussling with him to help him I wouldn't say inhibit that or regulate to integrate it and one of the consequences of that was he became a very good athlete and So why is relevant? Well, because it wasn't like he stopped being assertive or even aggressive. It's that he learned how to put that aggression in its proper place in relationship to a goal that was much more sophisticated than merely getting his own way moment to moment. Okay, so integration's a better, like a very sophisticated athlete, a team athlete in particular, isn't not aggressive and they're not inhibiting their aggression on the playing field. They may now and then when they're provoked, let's say, but all things considered what they've done is subordinate their aggression to a higher order goal that enables them to be more successful but also to be successful in a maximally social and sustainable way and Piaget's point and he's absolutely right about this is that that's much better conceptualized as integration and then with regard to impulse because I said I would return to that I spent a lot of time walking through the behavioral literature right and a lot of that was derived from animal experiments and it was predicated on the idea that if you could explain something on the basis of a deterministic reflex you should. There's something to be said for that hypothesis. Don't make your theory any more complex than it needs to be. How far can you get with a theory of chained reflexes, a deterministic theory? The behaviors got a long way. They couldn't get to the highest strata of human endeavor with a chained reflex theory, but there was a lot of things they did that were very good. But one of the things they made a big mistake about was to conceptualize motivational states, let's say, as impulses or drives. That's not sufficient because it fails to take into account the effect of those states on perception. So it's much better to think of a motivated state, this is what helped me integrate behavioral theory with psychoanalytic theory, especially the psychoanalytic theory of Religious Endeavor You certainly see that in addiction, let's say. They have their emotions. Like they are small personalities, unidimensional, very narrow-minded personalities, but they're personalities, they're not impulses. So are they personalities within our, what most people would think of as our larger personality? I mean, what I'm hearing is that, let's say somebody's an addict. It depends on how integrated you are, because you could be nothing but a succession of dominion of sub-personalities. That's what a two-year-old is. Right? And so you have to build an integrating personality on top of those sub-personalities, but not in a manner that inhibits them. That means your socialization is unsophisticated. Even Freud knew this because even though he had basically an inhibitory model of, say, superego regulation, he believed that a healthy personality would have the impulse of aggression and the impulse of sexuality to take two major lower-order motivational states into account, would have them integrated into the functioning ego. The issue is integration. And so what you're doing when you're social, like, okay, when my son, for example, would become willful in a manner that I regarded as counterproductive for him and the household,",
