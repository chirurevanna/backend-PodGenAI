  "transcription": " Before we get to the origins of the universe and the organization of the planets relative to the Sun and their spins, etc You said something that at least to me feels in Intuitively so true and I think it's very likely to be true for everybody Which is that there's something about looking up into space, especially at night when we see the stars and Hopefully see the stars. We'll talk about light pollution a little bit later. When we see the stars that yes, we know these things are far away. Yes, we know that they occupy a certain position in space. They have a diameter, et cetera. We might not know what that is just by looking at them. You probably do, but they also change our perception of time. And if I were to say one thing about the human brain especially is that sure, it's got all these autonomic functions. It regulates heart rate, digestion, et cetera, sleep-wake cycles. It can remember, it can think, it can have states like rage or anger or happiness or delight. But what's remarkable about the human brain is that it can think into the past, it can be quote unquote present, and it can project into the future. And I'm sure other animals can do that, but we do this exquisitely well and we make plans on the basis of this ability to contract or expand our notion of time. As a non-biologist but somebody who I think appreciates and understands biology, why do you think it is that when we look up into the sky, even though most people might not realize that those stars probably aren't there and occupying the position that we think they are, some of them probably are, some of them aren't. They existed a long time ago. But without knowing that, why do you think that looking up at the stars gives us the sense of an expansion of time as opposed to just the expansion of space? Well, first of all, we have to take ourselves back to deep prehistory. We know that ancients were looking at the constellations because they were seemingly either in control of or correlated with or perhaps causative of the seasons. And that was of divine importance, supreme importance for them, right? Their whole existence in early agrarian societies, hunting societies, gathering societies. So they had to know about time. So time, the essence of time and that on large scale for seasons, for holidays, for festivals, for propitiation of deities and so forth, they had to keep track of it. And that's why in the caves in Lascaux that date back to the 40,000 BCE, they depict constellations. Orion, the hunter, Taurus, the bull, all these different constellations, they depict them there. Now, partially that was because Netflix didn't exist back then, right? There was no TikTok and so there wasn't much to do at night. And in fact, the more you're out at night, you probably increased your opportunity to be consumed by some predator, right? So you were more focused on being stationary, observing. And as I said, we can do astronomy uniquely so amongst all the sciences with just the equipment we're born with, you know, measurements with our eyes with respect to landmarks to calculate patterns. And humans are exceptionally good at recognizing patterns, sometimes too good. So for instance, knowing that a certain swath of stars is present at one time of year and not another relative to say the contour of a mountain ridge. Yes. and the repetition of it over and passed down through generations before there was written language. There was pictography, there was the cave paintings and so forth. There was oral language and that was it. Written language is only 10,000 years old or something like that. So to store information, that meant it was a continuity between generations. My great-great-great-great-grandfathers, elders, whatever, taught me that when the moon is in this constellation, the sun is in this constellation, we should plant or we should harvest in other times. And so it was and we still do use the rotation of the earth hasn't changed that much since this 40,000 year period. I mean, the axis in which it rotates, that's a different story. But the actual spin rate, the angular momentum of the Earth has not depreciably changed that much. And so the positions of these objects were of such importance that the ancients would use them for all these purposes. But there were so few things that changed position that they actually had names for them. They're called planets. So planet in Greek, it's like the word plane, like airplane. It means something that moves or wanders. So when you name something, it means it's pretty different from the other things in which are not associated with that characteristic. So the planets, there were only five that they could see at that time up to Saturn. And they actually would associate those not only with astronomical events, but events down on Earth. That's what connected the Earth. So we have legacy of that in our calendar today. So Sunday, named after the sun, Monday, moon, Tuesday, and you go to the Latin languages. I think it's Mercury, Mercury Day, Ventury Day, Venus Day, so you go to the romance languages. And then the only one that's not a Latin name is of course for Thor, the god Thor, Thursday. And then it comes back Saturn Day, Saturday. So they were all used as a clock. And people don't really grasp this. I mean, we have an Apple Watch, we have whatever. We didn't have a clock that was functional, that would work on all different time zones and all different conditions on the pitching deck of a ship, until the 1700s basically. It was a huge problem. And so measuring time became crucial for commerce, for human culture and civilization to arise, for education, and obviously for planting, harvesting, and so forth. So there was an obvious connection between the two. They believed, actually, that they were causative, that actually the position of the planet Jupiter determined something on the day of your birth and the Sun's relative position with respect to it, determined something about your future and your prospects in life and so forth. So when I'm not confused for a cosmetologist, because of my lovely hair and makeup, I'm usually asked, you know, oh you're an astronomer I'm a Virgo, you know, so what's gonna happen to me? I'm like I used to be okay. That's an astrologer I'm not an astrologer, but now I just I kind of lean into it I'm like, ooh that you're gonna get a letter from the IRS next week and that lump on your ass You mean you're playing games with them. Yeah, you don't believe in astrology There's no evidence for astrology. In fact, there's there's you know, many many random controlled, you know trials or double-bundle study that showed not only is it it's almost counter to the evidence, you know, like they say that a monkey can throw a dart at a stock chart and get you know, do better than most hedge fund managers or something like it actually astrologers are even worse like I don't even know a a protozoa can throw a dart. It's almost anti-correlated with what reality is. So no, there's certainly no validity to that. And I had a provocative tweet, whatever post recently, and it was about, there's actually, we believe there are 12 zodiac signs, and that dates back to the Persians and the Babylonians and how they divided up them and it almost divides, you know, they were fascinated with the number 60. So that was the base of their number system. Our number system is 10 because we have 10 figures. For some reason they love base 60. I don't know why. And so they love things that divided evenly into it. 10 does, but anyway, you know, hashtag fail for the Babylonians, but they divided it up into 12 zodiac signs, so we still use those. There's a problem though. The zodiac that you're, do you know what this is? Do you know what determines your zodiac sign? No. Okay, so it's determined by the position of the sun. What constellation was the sun in on the day you were born? September 26th. So that means that the sun was in the constellation Virgo. Oh no, you were Libra? Libra, okay. So you do know what you are, but you don't know why you are. So Libra means it's a constellation. There's 88 constellations that are accepted by astronomers, and one of them is Libra. And the path that the sun and the moon and all the planets travel in is called the zodiac It's confined to a plane because the same proto-planet proto-solar system disk From which we formed out of all the planets came out of a nebular cloud a cloud of gas Dust rocks and so forth that came from a pre-existing star that exploded creating what's called a super supernova. The supernova provided the materials to make not only the Earth, but the entire solar system, including the sun. That happened about five billion years ago. And four billion years ago, the Earth formed out of that cloud. The spin of that disk, all things have a spin associated with them, like a figure skater, you know, as she's spinning around on her axis or whatever, she can have her arms out, brings them in, she spins faster. That's called conservation of angular momentum. Spin is a type of angular momentum. The whole disk is spinning in a plane. It's like this desk, this table that we're sitting at. If you're listening, you imagine a flat table. It's spinning, a circular disk is spinning with a certain direction. All the objects are moving in that same direction due to conservation of this term called angular momentum. The sun moves in that, apparently moves in that position. Obviously we're rotating around the sun, but it looks like the sun's coming around us. The moon is, Jupiter. So on the day you were born, there's a constellation behind the sun from our perspective that was Libra on September 26. And that was the day that you were born. That determines the fact that you're a Libra. But there's a problem. In December, where we are now, the sun is actually in a different constellation, the one that doesn't exist according to the zodiac that was created something like 6,000, 5,000 years ago. It's called Ophiuchus. So there's a certain segment of people born in a 17-day stretch in December, late November to early early December that are actually Ophiuchans or Ophiuchuses or whatever. So that should obliterate astrology as any semblance of a science because they didn't even know this constellation existed and yet something like 12% of all people",
