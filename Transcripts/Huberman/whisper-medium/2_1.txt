  "transcription": " And now for my discussion with Dr. Laurie Santos. Dr. Laurie Santos, welcome. Thanks so much for having me on the show. I want to talk about this thing that everyone seems to want, but most everyone has trouble keeping themselves in a state of happiness, which raises the question of whether or not we should even be seeking to constantly be in a state of happiness. But just to sit back from that question for a moment, how should we think about the relationship between emotions and this thing that we call cognition? Because I think a lot of where we're going today is to distinguish between feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. And as neuroscientists, psychologists, et cetera, we have to understand the difference between emotions and cognition and maybe where they overlap. So if you could educate us a bit on that, I think that will set the stage nicely for understanding happiness. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you started there actually because, you know, the very definition of happiness, I think, is social science.",
