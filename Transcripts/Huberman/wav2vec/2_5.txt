  "transcription": "AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR LARRY SANTOS DOCTOR LARRY SANTOS WELCOME THANKS FOR SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON THE SHOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS THING THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT BUT MOST EVERYONE HAS TROUBLE KEEPING THEMSELVES IN A STATE OF HAPPINESS WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD EVEN BE SEEKING TO CONSTANTLY BE IN A STATE OF HAPPINESS BUT JUST TO SIT BACK FROM THAT QUESTION FOR A MOMENT HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENM TIONS AND THIS THING THAT WE CALL COGNITION BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DAY IS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FEELINGS THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS AND AS NERO SCIENTISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS ET CETERA WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMOTIONS AND COGNITION AND MAYBE WHERE THEY OVERLAP SO IF YOU COULD EDUCATE US A BIT ON THAT I THINK THAT WILL SET THE STAGE NICELY FOR UNDERSTANDING HAPPINESS WELL I'M GLAD YOU STARTED THERE ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE VERY DEFINITION OF HAPPINESS I THINK A SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TEND TO THINK ABOUT IT INCLUDES BOTH OF THESE PARTS RIGHT SO I THINK SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TEND TO THINK ABOUT HAPPINESS AS BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE SO BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE IS SORT OF THE EMOTION SIDE IHT A DECENT NUMBER OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS MAYBE SLIGHTLY LESS NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE YOU EXISTING IN YOUR LIFE FEELS GOOD THAT'S KIND OF AN EMOTIONAL PART RIGHT A BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO KIND OF HOW YOU THINK YOUR LIFE IS GOING DO YOU HAVE A PURPOSE ORE YOU KIND OF HAPPY WITH HOW THINGS ARE GOING IT'S HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE WHICH IS A SORT OF COGNITIVE THING AND SO EVEN THE EARLIEST SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WHO STARTED THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS AT THE TIME THEY CALL IT SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING I THINK PSYCHOLOGIST ERE LIKE WO HAPPINESS TOWNS SOUNDS TOO WOOY LIKE WE'LL CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT MEANS EXACTLY THE SAME THING IT MEANS SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING RIGHT WHEN THEY START TO THINK ABOUT SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING THEY DIVIDED IT INTO THIS SORT OF AFFECTIVE EMOTIONAL PART WHICH IS LIKE HOW YOU FEEL IN YOUR LIFE BUT ALSO THIS COGNITIVE PART HOW YOU THINK YOUR LIFE IS GOING SO THAT BASIC DICODOMY HAS BEEN THERE SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF FOLKS STUDYING HAPPINESS SCIENTIFICALLY I'M ALREADY STRUCK BY THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN YOUR LIFE VERSUS WITH YOUR LIFE A ONE REQUIRES A A KIND OF FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCING OF LIFE IN YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW YOU WAKE UP FEELING GOOD ARE YOU FEELING GOOD WITH YOUR INSIDE OF YOUR FRIENDSHIPS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS FAMILY ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP SCHOOL WORK THE OTHER INVOLVES A BIT OF A THIRD PERSONING OF SELFO LOOKING AT ONE'S AM C V EITHER ACTUAL C V OR AM REFLECTED C THROUGH THE LENS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND KIND OF GETTING A SENSE LIKE AM I DOING WELL AM I NOT DOING WELL AM I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IF I MAY IS TO BE HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE REGARDLESS OF THE THIRD PERSONING PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT DOING DAMAGE TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAPPINESS AND LIFEWE I THINK I DEALIT IT'D BE NICE TO DO BOTH RIGHT AND I THINK THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THESE THINGS DISSOCIATE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW YOU INTERACT WITH LOTS OF INTERESTING RICH PEOPLE OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK A LOT OF THEM HAVE IT KIND OF IN THEIR LIFE FEELS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT THEY HAVE LOTS OF HEDONIC PLEASURES THA DRINKING NICE WINE HANGING OTBOY AMAZA HOW MUCH HOW MUCH I'M HOW MUCH SUFFERING THEY REPORT AH THAT'S INTRESTIING HOW MUC SUFFERING THEY REPORT SO THIS IS THE QUESTION IS IS IS THIS SORT OF COGNITIVE PART THE LIKE THIRD PERSON PART OR IS IT THE REPORTING PART AND I THINK WHEN THE PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE THINKING ABOUT IT THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS THE REPORTING PART RIGHT ANDAND THIS GETS TRICKY RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SEE FOLKS HAVING THEIR NICE GLASS OF WINE ON THE BEACH AND I'M THINKING LIKE THAT'S WITH LOTS OF POSITIVE EMOTION LIKE I BET IF I TESTED THEM AND COULD HAVE A DIRECT LOOK AT THEIR SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND PROBABLY BE PRETTY POSITIVE IT'S ONLY WHEN THEY REFLECT ON THEIR LIFE AND THEIR ASKING WHALE HOW'S IT GOING THAT THEY SAY ALL AND I DON'T KNOW MY STOCKS WENT DOWN ORE LIKE WHEN I HEAR ABOUT A LACK OF HAPPINESS LET ME THINK OF SOME OF THE KIND OF BULLET POINT ONES THAT SEEM TO COME UP REPETIVELY  THEY ARE INDEED NOT RELATED TO LACK OF RESOURCES I DON'T HEAR THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD AND THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR WHERE I D PART OF MY TIME IN WEAR I GREW UP WHICH IS IN SELICON VALLEY WHICH IS ALSO NOT EVERYONE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO HAVE A CRUDE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WEALTH THE MEAN IS SHIFTED VERY HIGH AND HENCE THE COST OF LIVING A BUT IT'S OFTEN CONCERNS ABOUT AM THEY'RE KIDS OR THEIR MOTHER IS ILL THEIR CHILD IS STRUGGLING IN A PARTICULAR WAY A VERY OFTEN THAT'S WHAT IT IS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OF WELL BEING IN THEIR KIDS RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OR PHYSICAL HEALTH OR OTHER RELATIVES MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH OR THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING POLITICALLY BUT WE WON'T GE GYWEO THERE YET NO I THINK THIS IS TRUE RIGHT YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF OUR HAPPINESS IS MADE UP OF THE HAPPINESS OF OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT EM BOTH KIND OF HOW THEY'RE DOING AND HOW WE THINK THEY'RE DOING COGNITIVELY BUT LITERALLY JUST EMOTIONALLY RIGHT YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN AROUND A FAMILY MEMBER OR A SPOUSE WHO WAS INCREDIBLY PISSED OFF",
