  "transcription": "BEFORE WE GET TO THE ORIGINS OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PLANETS RELATIVE TO THE SUN AND THEIR SPINS ET CETERA YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST TO ME FEELS INTUITIVELY SO TRUE AND I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY TO BE TRUE FOR EVERYBODY WHICH IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT LOOKING UP INTO SPACE ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHEN WE SEE THE STARS AND HOPEFULLY SEE THE STARS WE'LL TALK ABOUT LIGHT POLLUTION AND LIITTLE BIT LATER WHEN WE SEE THE STARS THAT YES WE KNOW THESE THINGS ARE FAR AWAY YES WE KNOW THAT THEY OCCUPY A CERTAIN POSITION IN SPACE THEY HAVE A DIAMETER ET CETERA WE MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT THAT IS JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM YOU PROBABLY DO BUT BUT THEY ALSO CHANGE OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME AND YOU KNOW IF I WERE TO SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN ESPECIALLY IS THAT SURE IT'S GOT ALL THESE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IT REGULATES HEART RATE DIGESTION ET CETERA SLEEP WAKE CYCLES IT CAN REMEMBER IT CAN THINK IT CAN HAVE STATES LIKE RAGE OR ANGER HAPPINESS OR DELIGHT BUT WHAT'S REMARKABLE ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS THAT IT CAN THINK INTO THE PAST IT CAN BE PRESENT AND IT CAN PROJECT INTO THE FUTURE AND I'M SURE OTHER ANIMALS CAN DO THAT BUT WE DO THIS EXQUISITELY WELL AND WE MAKE PLANS ON THE BASIS OF THIS ABILITY TO CONTRACT OR EXPAND OUR NOTION OF TIME AS A NON BIOLOGY BUT SOMEBODY WHO I THINK APPRECIATES AND UNDERSTANDS BIOLOGY WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK UP INTO THE SKY EVEN THOUGH MOST PEOPLE MIGHT NOT REALIZE THAT THOSE STARS PROBABLY AREN'T THERE AND OCCUPYING THE POSITION THAT WE THINK THEY ARE SOME OF THEM PROBABLY ARE SOME OF THEM AREN'T THEY EXISTED A LONG TIME AGO BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THAT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT LOOKING UP AT THE STARS GIVES GIVES US THE SENSE OF AN EXPANSION OF TIME AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE EXPANSION OF SPACE WELL FIRST EL WEHAVE TO TAKE OURSELVES BACK ON TODE WE KNOW THAT ANCIENTS WERE LOOKING AT AT THE CONSTELLATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE SEEMINGLY EITHER IN CONTROL OF OR CORRELATED WITH OR PERHAPS CAUSATIVE OF THE SEASONS AND THAT WAS OF CERTAINTY OT DIVINE IMPORTANCE SUPREME IMPORTANCE FOR THEM RIT THEIR WHOLE EXISTENCE IN EARLY AGRARIAN SOCIETIES HUNTING SOCIETIES GATHERING SOCIE SO THEY HAD TO KNOW ABOUT TIME SO TIME THE ESSENCE OF TIME AND THAT ON LARGE SCALE FOR SEASONS FOR HOLIDAYS FOR FESTIVALS FOR TIATION OF DEITIES AND SO FORTH THEY HAD TO KEEP TRACK OF IT AND THAT'S WHY IN THE CAVES IN LASCO THAT YOU KNOW DATE BACK TO THE FORTY THOUSAND B C E A THEY DEPICT CONSTELLATIONS ORIAN THE HUNTER TOURUS THE BULL ALL THESE DIFFERENT CONSTELLATIONS THEY DEPICT THEM THERE NOW PARTIALLY THAT WAS BECAUSE YOU KNOW NET FLICK DIDN'T EXIST BACK DIDN'T RIGHT THERE WAS NO TICK TALK AND AND SO THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO AT NIGHT AND IN FACT THE MORE YOU WERE OUT AT NIGHT YOU PROBABLY INCREASED YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE CONSUMED BY SOME CREDITOR RIGHT SO YOURE YOU WERE MORE FOCUSED ON BEING TONARY OBSERVING AND AS I SAID WE CAN DO ASTRONOMY UNIQUELY SO AMONGST ALL THE SCIENCES WITH JUST THE EQUIPMENT WE'RE BORN WITH YOU KNOW MEASUREMENTS WITH OUR EYES WITH RESPECT TO LANDMARKS TO CALCULATE PATTERNS AND HUMANS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AT RECOGNIZING PATTERNS SOMETIMES TOO GOOD SO FOR INSTANCE KNOWING THAT A CERTAIN SWATH OF STARS IS PRESENT AT ONE TIME OF YEAR AND NOT ANOTHER RELATIVE TO SAY THE M THE CONTOUR OF A MOUNTAIN RIDGE YES AND AND THE REPETITION OF IT OVER AND PASSED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS BEFORE THERE WAS LANGUAGE THERE WAS PICTOGRAPHY THERE WAS H CAVE PAINTINGS AND SO FORTH THERE WAS ORAL LANGUAGE AND THAT WAS IT FOR YOU KNOW WRITTEN LANGUAGE IS ONLY NOW TEN THOUSAND YEARS OLD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO TO STORE INFORMATION THAT MEANT IT WAS A CONTINUITY BETWEEN GENERATIONS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S ELDERS WHATEVER TAUGHT ME THAT WHEN THE MOON IS IN THIS CONSTELLATION THE SUN IS IN THIS CONSTELLATION A WE SHOULD PLANT OR WE SHOULD EAT A HARVEST AND OTHERIN OTHER TIMES AND SO IT WAS IN IT WE STILL DO USE YOU KNOW THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH YOU KNOW HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH SINCE THIS FORTY THOUSAND YEAR PERIOD RIGHT I MEAN THE AXIS ON WHICH IT ROTATES THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY BUT BUT T THE ACTUAL SPIN RATE THE ANGULAR MOMENTUM OF THE EARTH HAS NOT APPRECIABLY CHANGED THAT MUCH AND SO THE POSITIONS OF THESE OBJECTS WERE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT THE ANCIENTS WOULD USE THEM FOR ALL THESE PURPOSES BUT THERE WERE SO FEW THINGS THAT CHANGED POSITION THAT THEY ACTUALY HAD NAMES FOR THEM THEY ARE CALLED PLANETS SO PLANET IN GREEK IT'S LIKE THE WORD PLANE LIKE AIR IT MEANS SOMETHING THAT MOVES OR WANDERS SO WHEN YOU NAME SOMETHING IT MEANS IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THINGS AND WHICH ARE NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THAT CHARACTERISTIC SO THE PLANETS THERE WERE ONLY FIVE THAT THEY COULD SEE AT THAT TIME UP TO SATURN AND THEY ACTUALLY WOULD ASSOCIATE THOSE NOT ONLY WITH ASTRONOMICAL EVENTS BUT EVENTS DOWN ON EARTH THAT'S WHAT CONNECTED THE EARTH'S A WEEK WE HAVE LEGACY OF THAT IN OUR CALENDAR TO DAY SO SUNDAY NAMED AFTER THE SUN MONDAY MOON TUESDAY ATD YOU GO TO THE LATIN LANGUAGES I THINK IT'S A MERCURY MERCURY WHICH IS MERCURY DAY A VANTEDE VENUS DAY SO YOU GO THE ROMANCE LANGUAGES AND THEN THE ONLY ONE THAT'S NOT A LATIN NAME IS OF COURSE FOR THOR THE GOD THOR THURSDAY AND THEN COMES BACK SATURN DAY SATURDAY SO THEY WERE ALL USED AS A CLOCK AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY GRASP THIS A MEN WE HAVE AN APPLE WATCH WE HAVE WHATEVER WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLOCK THAT WAS FUNCTIONAL THAT WOULD WORK ON ALL DIFFERENT TIME ZONES AND ALL DIFFERENT CONDITIONS ON THE PITCHING DECK OF A SHIP TILL THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ALLY IT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AND SO MEASURING TIME BECAME CRUCIAL FOR COMMERCE FOR YOU KNOW HUMAN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION TO ARISE FOR EDUCATION AND OBVIOUSLY FOR PLANTING HARVESTING AND SO FORTH SO THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO THEY BELIEVED ACTUALLY THAT THEY WERE POSITIVE THAT ACTUALLY THE POSITION OF THE PLANET JUPITER DETERMINED SOMETHING ON THE DAY OF YOUR BIRTH AND THE SUN'S RELATIVE POSITION WITH RESPECT TO IT DETERMINED SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR YOUR YOUR FUTURE AND YOUR AND YOR PROSPECTS IN LIFE AND SO FORTH I'M NOT CONFUSED FOR A COSMOTOLOGIST YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF MY LOVELY HAIR AND MAKE UP  I'M USUALLY ASKED YOU KNOW OH YOU'RE AN ASTRONOMER  I'M A VERGO YOU KNOW SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME 'M LIKE I USED TO BE K THAT'S AN ASTROLOGER I'M NOT AN ASTROLOGER BUT NOW I JUST AN LEAN INTO IT I'M LIKE O THAT YOU'RE GOIG TO GET A LETTER FROM THE I R S NEXT WEEK AND AT THAT LUMP ON YOUR YOU MEAN EN YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE PLAYING GAMES WITH HIM YES YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY A THERE'S NO EVIDENCE FOR ASTROLOGY IN FACT THERE'S THERE'SO MANY MANY RANDOM CONTROL NO TRIALS OR DOUBLE ONSU THAT SHOWED NOT ONLY IS IT IT'S ALMOST COUNTER TO THE EVIDENCE YOU KNOW LIKE THEY SAY THAT A MONKEY CAN THROW A DART AT A STOCK CHART AND YET YOU NOW DO BETTER THAN MOST HEDGE FUN MANAGERSS ONLIK ACTUALLY ASTROLOGERS ARE EVEN WORSE LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW PROTOZOA COULD THROWADARTIT'S ALMOST ANTI CORRELATED WEKNOW WITH WITH WHAT REALITY  SO NO THERE'S CERTAINLY NO VALIDITY TO THAT AND I ADDEDA PROVOCATIVE TO EAT YOU KNOW WHATEVERPOST RECENTLY  AND IT WAS ABOUT THERE'S ACTUALLY THIRT YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THERE ARE TWELVE ZODIACASSIGNS AND THAT DATES BACK TO THE PERSIANS AND THE BABYLONIANS AND HOW THEY DIVIDED UP THEM AND IT ALMOST DIVIDES YONO THEY WERE FASCINATED WITH THE NUMBER SIXTY SO THAT THAT WAS THE BASE OF THEIR NUMBER SYSTEM OUR NUMBER SYSTEM IS TEN ECAUSE WEHAVE TEN FOR SOME REASON THEY LOVE BASE SIXTY I DON'T KNOW WHY A AND SO THEY LOVE THINGS THAT DIVIDE IT EVENLY INTO IT TEN DOES BUT ANYWAY YOU KNOW HASHTAG FAIL FOR FOR THE BABYLONIANS BUT THEY DIVIDED IT UP INTO TWELVE TWELVE A ZODIAC SIGNS SO WE STILL USE THOSE THERIS A PROBLEM THOUGH THE ZODIAC THAT YOUR DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS DO YOU KNOW WHAT DETERMINES YOUR ZODIAC NO OH SO IT'S DETERMINED BY THE POSITION OF THE SUN WHAT CONSTELLATION WAS THE SUN IN ON THE DAY YOU WERE BORN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTH SO A WHEN THE THAT MEANS THAT THE SUN WAS IN THE CONSTELLATION VERGO OH NO YOU WERE A LIBRA LIBRA LIBRA YOU DO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUT YOUDON KNOW WHY YOU ARE SO LIBRA MEANS TAT IT'S A CONSTELLATION THERE'S EIGHTY EIGHT CONSTELLATIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED BY ASTRONOMER AND THE A ONE OF THEM IS LIBRA AND THE PATH THAT THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ALL THE PLANETS TRAVEL IN IS CALLED THE ZODIAC IS CONFINED TO A PLANE BECAUSE THE SAME A PROTOPAN PROTO SOLAR SYSTEM DISK FROM WHICH WE FORMED OUT OF ALL THE PLANETS CAME OUT OF A NEBULAR CLOUD A CLOUD OF GAS DUST ROCKS AND SO FORTH THAT CAME FROM A PRE EXISTING STAR THAT EXPLODED CREATING WHAT'S CALLED A SUPER NOVA THE SUPER NOVA PROVIDED THE MATERIALS TO MAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH BUT THE ENTIRES SYSTEM INCLUDING THE SUN THAT HAPPENED ABOUT FIVE BILLION YEARS AGO AND FOUR BILLION YEARS AGO THE EARTH FORMED OUT OF THAT CLOUD THAT THE SPIN OF THAT DISK ALL THINGS HAVE A SPIN ASSOCIATED WITH THEM LIKE A FIGURE SKATER YOU KNOWAS SHE'S SPINNING AROUND ON HER AXIS OR WHATEVER SHE CAN HAVE HER ARMS OUT BRINGS THEM IN SHE SPINS FASTER THAT'S CALLED CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM SPIN IS A TYPE OF ANGULA MENTUM THE WHOLE DISK IS SPINNING IN A PLANE IT'S LIKE THIS DESK THIS TABLE THAT WE'RE SITTING AT IFY LISTENING YOU IMAGINE A FLAT TABLE IT'S SPINNING A CIRCULAR SOF SPINNING WITH A CERTAIN DIRECTION ALL THE OBJECTS ARE MOVING IN THAT SAME DIRECTION DUE TO CONSERVATION OF THIS TERM CALLED ANGULAR MOMENTUM THE SUN MOVES AND THAT APPARENTLY MOVES IN THAT POSITION OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ROTATING AROUND THE SUN BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE SUN'S COMING AROUND US THE MOON IS JUPITER SO ON THE DAY YOU WERE BORN THERE'S A CONSTELLATION BEHIND THE SUN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS LIBRA ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTH AND THAT WAS THE DAY THAT YOU WERE BORN THAT DETERMINES THE FACT THAT YOU ARE LIBRA BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN DECEMBER WHERE WE ARE NOW THE SUN IS ACTUALLY IN A DIFFERENT CONSTELLATION THE ONE THAT DOESN'T EXIST ACCORDING TO THE ZODIAC THAT WAS CREATED SOMETHING LIKE SIX OU FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO CALLED OPIUCAS SO THERE IS A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF PEOPLE BORN IN A SEVENTEEN DAY STRETCH IN DECEMBER LATE NOVEMBER TO EARLY DECEMBER THAT ARE ACTUALLY OPIUCANS OR OPHIUCUS OR WHATEVER SO THAT SHOULD OBLITERATE ASTROLOGY AS ANY SEMBLANCE OF A SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS CONSTELLATION EXISTED AND YET SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE PER CENT OF ALL PEOPLE",
