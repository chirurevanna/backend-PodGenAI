  "transcription": "WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCAST WHERE WE DISCUSS SCIENCE AND SCIENCE BASE TOOLS FOR EVERYDAY LIFE I'M ANDREW HUBERMAN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEURO BIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY IS DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY IS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERTS IN PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CHILDREN IF YOU DO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ABSOLUTELY FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T WELL YOU WERE ONCE A CHILD PERHAPS YOU'RE EVEN STILL A CHILD TO DAY'S EPISODE ALSO WILL HAVE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY TO YOUR LIFE TODAY DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY TEACHES US AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF EXTREMELY VALUABLE TOOLS FOR THE WORKPLACE FOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS FOR FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL TYPES NOT JUST PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS AND OF COURSE ALSO FOR PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS WE DISCUSS THEMES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY ON THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCASTE TOPICS SUCH AS GILT WHICH DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY OFFERS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON ONE THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE AND THAT FRANKLY I DON'T THINK ANY ONE HAS HEARD BEFORE IN FACT SHE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK IS GUILT AND AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF EMOTIONS AND OFFERS YOU VERY USEFUL PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE GUILT AND HOW TO WORK WITH GUILT WE ALSO EXTENSIVELY DISCUSS FRUSTRATION OR WHAT SHE CALLS FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THEME FOR EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE AS DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY SO LY POINTS OUT ESSENTIAL TO THE LEARNING PROCESS OF ANYTHING AT EVERY AGE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT AND YOU APPLY SOME OF THE VERY SIMPLE RULES AND TOOLES THAT DOCTOR KENNEDY EXPLAINS DURING THE POD CAST I ASSURE YOU YOU CAN LEARN MANY MORE THINGS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND WITH MUCH GREATER SATISFACTION IF NOT DURING THE PROCESS CERTAINLY AT THE END WHEN YOU MASTER THAT LEARNING AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE THEMES THAT WE DISCUSS DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE AGAIN WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE CHILDREN I ASSURE YOU THAT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR ALL O YOUR RELATIONSHIPS YOU WILL NOTICE DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE THAT OUR STUDIO BACKDROP IS DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOTICE THAT FOR ONCE I WAS NOT WEARING THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF SHIRT THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS EPISODE WAS RECORDED DURING THE LA FIRES WHAT WAS INITIALLY CALLED THE PALISADES FIRE AND THEN SPREAD TO MULTIPLE FIRES THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY SO WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS OUR NORMAL STUDIO SO I WANT TO EXPRESS EXTREME GRATITUDE TO RICH ROLL OUR GOOD FRIEND IN THE POD CASTING SPACE WHO ALLOWED US TO USE IS PODCAST STUDIO WHICH IS WHERE I AM SEATED NOW AND WHERE I HELD THE DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY FIRST OFF OUR ENTIRE TEAM OUR HOMES AND OUR STUDIO ARE FINE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES LOST PETS AND SADLY THERE HAVE BEEN FATALITIES DURING THE L A FIRES SO OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE HOPE EVERYONE REMAINS SAFE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO CAUSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME TO DAY'S EPISODE DOES INCLUDE SPONSORS AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY WELCOME BACK I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE GRATEFUL TO RICH ROLL FOR LENDING US HIS STUDIO UNDER THE DIRESS OF FIRES IN LOS ANGELES I'M PRAYING THAT HIS HOME IS O K AH IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS MOMENT BUT ANY EVENT LET'S TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE AND IF WE CAN PLACE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF PARENTING THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT I'M CERTAIN THAT THIS HAS A BROADER THEME THAT PERTAINS TO EVERYBODY SO I LOVE THE THEORY OF EMOTIONS OR HOW WE WOULD THEORETICALLY RESPOND TO SOMETHING BUT THEN THERE'S THE REALITY SO AS A PARENT LET'S SAY E YOU HAVE A STANCE IN YOUR HOME AND IN YOUR FAMILY THAT IT'S OK TO BES ISADNESS IS NORMAL IT HAPPENS IT PASSES ET CETERA BUT LET'S SEE YOUR FEELING PARTICULARLY SAD ABOUT SOMETHING DO YOU EXPRESS THAT AND SHOW THAT IN FRONT OF YOUR KIDS BECAUSE I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT YOUNG KIDS IN PARTICULAR YOUNGER THAN EIGHT OR NINE PERHAPS SHOULDN'T BE AWARE THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE EXPERIENCING SAY EXTREME SADNESS BECAUSE IT CAN BE SCARY TO THEMO THEY MIGHT FEEL LIKE THEIR WORLD IS D STABILIZING AND THEN A WE ALSO HEAR LOT ABOUT KIDS FEELING LIKE THEY HAD TO PARENT THE PARENTS AND THEN THIS WHOLE THING BECOMES PRETTY COMPLICATED SO WELL  THERE'S NO PERFECT WORLD WHERE ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO EVERY SINGLE TIME HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THIS BUSINESS OF MODELLING EMOTIONS AND ALSO ENCOURAGING KIDS TO BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS YEND I THINK EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT TO SHARE APPLIES YOU KNOW IN THE WORKPLACE RIGHT CAN A BOSS BE YOU KNOW REALLY UPSET IN FRONT OF THE PERSON THEY MANAGE MANAGEMENT RIGHT SO IT'S ALL THE SAME STUFF SO",
