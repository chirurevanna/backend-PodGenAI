PODCAST HOSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS JOSHATSKIN SO HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED BUT HE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL TEACHER OF THE LEARNING PROCESS HE TOOK WHAT HE LEARNED IN CHESS AND ABOUT LEARNING CHESS AND APPLIED THAT TO MARTIAL ARTS TO FOILING ET CETERA AND FROM PARTICIPATING IN ALL THOSE ENDEAVOURS HE WAS ABLE TO DISTIL OUT THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF LEARNING AND HOW TO TAILOR ONE'S LEARNING PROCESS TO ONE'S OWN UNIQUE PERSONALITY AND STYLE FLAWS AND TENDENCY TO MAKE MISTAKES AND HOW TO LEVERAGE ALL O THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LEARN BETTER IN FACT THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE I PROMISE THAT YOU WILL CONSTANTLY BE REFLECTING ON WHERE YOU EXPERIENCE THINGS LIKE TENSION AND FEAR BOTH IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE YOUR PROFESSIONAL LIFE YOUR

PEOPLE HE LOVES FOR THE THINGS HE LOVES AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HELPING OTHERS LEARN HOW TO LEARN BETTER I MUST SAY IT WAS A TRUE HONOUR TO SIT DOWN WITH JOSH I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF HIS WORK FOR A VERY LONG TIME YOU'LL ALSO LEARN THAT HE A REALLY NICE PERSON BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO CAUSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME THIS PODCAST EPISODE DOES INCLUDE SPONSORS AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH JOSH WATSKIN JOSH WATSKIN WELCOME THANK YOU MANT GOD TO BER FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN YOU A LONG TIME BECAUSE I SAW THE SEARCH FOR BOBBY FISHER AND I LEARNED ABOUT THE REAL HUMAN THAT WAS ABOUT YOU AND I READ THE ART OF LEARNING AND I MUST SAY I'M A FAN AND SOMEWHAT OBSESSED WITH THE UNIQUENESS OF YOUR ARC AND THE CHOICES YOU'VE MADE AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF LEARNING AS A PROCESS AND ITS UNIVERSAL PROPERTIES ITS SPECIFIC PROPERTIES AND DIFFERENT CONTEXTS SO I'M EXCITED TO DIVE IN I THINK FOR PEOPLE THAT PERHAPS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOU MAYBE YOU COULD JUST GIVE US A BROAD OVER VIEW OF YOUR BACK STORY LIKE THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE REALLY FOCUSED ON IN KIND OF CHUNKS IF YOU WILL A JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET FAMILIAR WITH THE INCREDIBLE THINGS YOU'VE DONE AND I THINK THAT REFLECTS THE UNIQUENESS OF YOUR CHOICE MAKING PROCESS WHICH THEN WE'LL GET INTO YES SURE THANK YOU MANES IT'S AN HONOR I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID AM YES SO I STARTED PLAYING CHESS I GROPE IN NEW YORK CITY DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN I STARTED PLAYING CHESS WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD AND I I DISCOVERED CHESS WALKING THROUGH WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK WITH MY MAM AND I REMEMBER WATCHING A DAY OR TWO AND THEN AT ONE POINT I BROKE AWAY FROM HER I WAS GOING TO PLAY ON MONKEY BARS AND I RAN OVER AND ASKED AN OLD MAN IF I COULD PLAY AND HE SAID YES AND MY MAAM WAS SURPRISED AND WE STARTED PLAYING I PLAYED MY FIRST GAME OF CHESS AND I REMEMBER THE VERY DISTINCT FEELING OF IT WAS AS IF I WAS DISCOVERING OR REDISCOVERING A LOST MEMORY IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS LEARNING SOMETHING NEW IT WAS LIKE I WAS WIPING AWAY THE DUST OR THE COBWEBS BETWEEN SOMETHING BETWEEN ME AND SOMETHING I HAD KNOWN VERY DEEPLY A ONE VERY STRANGE FEELING FOR A SIX YEAR OLD BOY AND THEN I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GAME I GOT REALLY INTENSELY INTO IT MY FIRST TEACHERS WERE THE HUSTLERS IN WASHINGTON SQUARE S T WAS JUST LIKE A RAUCOUS CROWD OF GUYS WHO TOOK ME UNDER THEIR WINGS STARTED TEACHING ME THE TACTICAL STREET SIDE OF THE GAME AND A I WAS JUST UNHINDERED AS A LEARNER WHICH IS INTERESTING FOR MY PROSPECTIVE NOW AS A DAD ECAUSE I MI MY LITT BOY CHARLEYS IS TAKING ON SERFING WITH THAT SAME KIND OF FREEDOM JUST THAT LIBERATED UNCOMPLICATED OUT OF HIS OWN WAY KIND OF AB YES AD AND BY THE TIME I WAS SEVEN I STARTED COMPETING AND THET I WAS A TOPERATER PLAYER FOR MY AGE IN THE COUNTRY FROM MY MOST OF THE YEARS FROM AGE SEVEN TO TWENTY THREE MYWHOLE CHEST CAREER SO IT WAS A VERY STRANGE UPBRINGING IN SOME WAYS WHICH HAS LED TO SOME QUIRKY ELEMENTS IN MY PSYCHOLOGY WHICH WAS THAT I WAS LIVING IN A PRESSURE COOKER OF COMPETITION FROM AGE SIX ON AND MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT WAS SPENT AS THE TARGET AND SO LIK GET FEUER IF YOU'RE COMPETING IN NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS AD I'D COMPETE IN IN YOUTH NATIONAL AND WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THEN OTHERWISE I'D BE COMPETING AGAINST ADULTS EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THEN YOU'RE THE TARGET SO ANY MISTAKE YOU MAKE AND KIDS MAKE MISTAKES ALL TIME WE ALL DO MY RIVALS AND THEIR COACHES WHO WERE STRONG MASTERS AND INTERNATIONAL MASTERS AND GRANDMASTERS WOULD BE ABLE TO STUDY AN ADULT STRONG PLAYERS CAN SEE VERY EASILY THE WEAKNESSES IN A CHILD AND SO THEY WOULD PREPARED FOR THEM SO IF I DIDN'T TAKE ON A WEAKNESS IT WOULD BE EXPLOITED AND I WOULD EXPERIENCE PAIN AND SO FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE NOT TAKING ON MY WEAKNESSES BECAME OUTSIDE OFHAT WAS OUTSIDE OF MY CONCEPTUAL SCHEME WHICH IS A REALLY INTERESTING THING TO GROW UP WITH AND IT'S IN MANY WAYS LIKE LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR A A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE DONE SINCE AND THEREARE LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT THAT UPBRINGING WHICH COULD BE UNHEALTHY A THING IN THE PUBLIC EYE YES I I VERY BIZARRE LUCKILY IT WAS BEFORE SOCIAL MEDIA YES SUPERY I'VE NEVER BEEN ON SOCIAL MEETING IN ANY WAY WHICH HAS BEEN A CHOICE YES WHEN I WAS ELEVENE THE BOOK SEARCHING FOR ROBBY FISHER CAME OUT ANDHEN WHENIWAS FIFTEEN THE MOVE CAME OUT AND AT THAT POINT I WAS YOU KNOW COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH CHESS IT WAS MY FIRST LOVE I WAS AN UNOBSTRUCTED LEARNER I WAS LOVED COMPETITION A LOT OF MY OPPONENTS WERE TRYING TO CONTROL THE GAME MEMORIZE OPENINGS FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIN BY FORCE BUT I LOVE THE BATTLE MY STYLE WAS TO CREATE CHAOS LIKE LAK IN WASHNTON SQUARE PARK AM FIND HIDDEN HARMONIES AND CHAOS AND I LOVED THAT SO AS GAME WENT ON AND THEY MOVED AWAY FROM THEIR OPENING PREPARATION AND CONTROLLING THINGS WE MOVED INTO MY POWER ZONE WHICH WAS THE FIGHT I LOVED THE FIGHT AND THEN MY CHESS LIFE IN MANY WAYS WAS WAS FREE FLOWING AND THEN THE MOVIE CAME OUT WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT THAT WAS LIKE AS AS YOU KNOW A YOUNG TEEN AGER ALL THE ATTENTION THE MEDIA CAMERAS EVERYWHERE GROUPIES ALL THE TEMPTATIONS AND I DIDN'T ASK FOR IT AND IT WAS REALLY IT WAS AN ALIENATING PERIOD FOR ME RELLED OUT THE CHESS AND AROUNDTHE TIME I STARTED TRAINING WITH A RUSSIAN CHESS TRAINER WHO STARTED URGING ME TO MOVE AWAY FROM MY SELF EXPRESSION AS A CHESS PLAYER AND TO STUDY THEE PLAYERS WHO WERE THE OPPOSITE OF ME I WAS A ATTACKING PLAYER AGGRESSIVE I PLAYED KIND OF IN THE STYLE NOT AT THE LEVEL BUT IN THE STYLE LIKE BOBBY FISHER OR GARIC SPAROV OR MCA TALL WHORLD CHAMPIONS WHO WERE LIKE HOT BLOODED AND I WAS BEING URGED TO STUDY THE MORE COLD BLOODED PROPHYLACTIC SIDE OF CHESS PETROSIAN KARPOV MORE CONSERVATIVE DEFENSIVE PLAYERS I WAS BEING TOLD INSTEAD OF SAYING IK WHAT WHAT DOES JOSH FEEL HERE WHAT WOULD KARPOV PLAY HERE WHO'S THE OPPOSITE OF ME AND SO THE COMBINATION OF THAT PUBLIC EYE AND THEN THE MOVEMENT AWAY FROM MY SELF EXPRESSION LED TO A PERIOD OF OBSTRUCTEDNESS AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AND AN INTERESTING THEME WE COULD TALK ABOUT AT ONE POINT IS THAT PASSAGE FROM A PRECONSCIOUS TO A POST CONSCIOUS COMPETITOR IN MANY WAYS I WENT FROM LIKE THAT FREEDOM OF PRECONSCIOUS COMPETITION INTO THE TUNNEL OF EXISTENTIAL CRISIS AND A AND I GRAPPLED WITH IT FOR YEARS AND WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN WHEN I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IAND DURING THAT GRAPPLING I WAS STILL ITS OPERATOR PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY I WAS WINNING NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS EVERY YEAR SO FROM THE OUTSIDE IT LOOKED GOOD BUT FROM THE INSIDE I WAS IN TURMOIL I WAS FIGHTING WITH MYSELF I HAD ALL THESE DEMONS AND THEN I LEFT THE U S I SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL STUDYING EAST ASIAN PHILOSOPHY MEDITATING REFLECTING  AND THEN MY STUDY OF CHESS IN THOSE YEARS AND I WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH CHESS STILL IT BECAME MUCH MOREOF AN INTROSPECTIVE PROCESS BECAME I WAS COMPETING AS INTENSELY AS EVER BUT CHESS BECAME CONNECTED TO LIFE AND WHEN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD I STARTED TRAINING AT THE HUMAN PERFORMANCE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME IT WAS CALLED L G E AM LAIR GROPPLE AND ECHEBERT AND ECHEBURY IT WAS A AM IT WAS A PERFORMANCE TRAINING CROSS DISCIPLINARY PERFORMANCE TRAINING CENTER THAT GIMLAIR OPENED UP AND NOW THEN T BECAME THE H B I LATER OND I NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT THAT I WAS I WAS WORKING WITH THESE PERFORMANCE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND I WAS AND I WAS AT THE GIM AND I WAS",
