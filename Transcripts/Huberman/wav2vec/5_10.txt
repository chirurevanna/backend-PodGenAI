STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY IS DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY IS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S FOREMOST EXPERTS IN PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS NOW YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CHILDREN IF YOU DO TODAY'S EPISODE IS ABSOLUTELY FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T WELL YOU WERE ONCE A CHILD PERHAPS YOU'RE EVEN STILL A CHILD TO DAY'S EPISODE ALSO WILL HAVE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND TOOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY TO YOUR LIFE TODAY DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY TEACHES US AN IMMENSE NUMBER OF EXTREMELY VALUABLE TOOLS FOR THE WORKPLACE FOR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS FOR FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL TYPES NOT JUST PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS AND OF COURSE ALSO FOR PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS WE DISCUSS THEMES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY ON THE HUBERMAN LAB PODCASTE TOPICS SUCH AS GILT WHICH DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY OFFERS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON ONE THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE AND THAT FRANKLY I DON'T THINK ANY ONE HAS HEARD BEFORE IN FACT SHE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK IS GUILT AND AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF EMOTIONS AND OFFERS YOU VERY USEFUL PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE GUILT AND HOW TO WORK WITH GUILT WE ALSO EXTENSIVELY DISCUSS FRUSTRATION OR WHAT SHE CALLS FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THEME FOR EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE FRUSTRATION TOLERANCE AS DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY SO LY POINTS OUT ESSENTIAL TO THE LEARNING PROCESS OF ANYTHING AT EVERY AGE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT AND YOU APPLY SOME OF THE VERY SIMPLE RULES AND TOOLES THAT DOCTOR KENNEDY EXPLAINS DURING THE POD CAST I ASSURE YOU YOU CAN LEARN MANY MORE THINGS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND WITH MUCH GREATER SATISFACTION IF NOT DURING THE PROCESS CERTAINLY AT THE END WHEN YOU MASTER THAT LEARNING AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE THEMES THAT WE DISCUSS DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE AGAIN WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE CHILDREN I ASSURE YOU THAT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR ALL O YOUR RELATIONSHIPS YOU WILL NOTICE DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE THAT OUR STUDIO BACKDROP IS DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOTICE THAT FOR ONCE I WAS NOT WEARING THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF SHIRT THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THIS EPISODE WAS RECORDED DURING THE LA FIRES WHAT WAS INITIALLY CALLED THE PALISADES FIRE AND THEN SPREAD TO MULTIPLE FIRES THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY SO WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS OUR NORMAL STUDIO SO I WANT TO EXPRESS EXTREME GRATITUDE TO RICH ROLL OUR GOOD FRIEND IN THE POD CASTING SPACE WHO ALLOWED US TO USE IS PODCAST STUDIO WHICH IS WHERE I AM SEATED NOW AND WHERE I HELD THE DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY FIRST OFF OUR ENTIRE TEAM OUR HOMES AND OUR STUDIO ARE FINE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES LOST PETS AND SADLY THERE HAVE BEEN FATALITIES DURING THE L A FIRES SO OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE HOPE EVERYONE REMAINS SAFE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO CAUSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME TO DAY'S EPISODE DOES INCLUDE SPONSORS AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY WELCOME BACK I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE GRATEFUL TO RICH ROLL FOR LENDING US HIS STUDIO UNDER THE DIRESS OF FIRES IN LOS ANGELES I'M PRAYING THAT HIS HOME IS O K AH IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS MOMENT BUT ANY EVENT LET'S TALK ABOUT EMOTIONS BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE AND IF WE CAN PLACE IT IN THE CONTEXT OF PARENTING THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT I'M CERTAIN THAT THIS HAS A BROADER THEME THAT PERTAINS TO EVERYBODY SO I LOVE THE THEORY OF EMOTIONS OR HOW WE WOULD THEORETICALLY RESPOND TO SOMETHING BUT THEN THERE'S THE REALITY SO AS A PARENT LET'S SAY EM YOU HAVE A STANCE IN YOUR HOME AND IN YOUR FAMILY THAT IT'S OK TO BES ISADNESS IS NORMAL IT HAPPENS IT PASSES ET CETERA BUT LET'S SEE YOUR FEELING PARTICULARLY SAD ABOUT SOMETHING DO YOU EXPRESS THAT AND SHOW THAT IN FRONT OF YOUR KIDS BECAUSE I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT YOUNG KIDS IN PARTICULAR YOUNGER THAN EIGHT OR NINE PERHAPS SHOULDN'T BE AWARE THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE EXPERIENCING SAY EXTREME SADNESS BECAUSE IT CAN BE SCARY TO THEMO THEY MIGHT FEEL LIKE THEIR WORLD IS D STABILIZING AND THEN A WE ALSO HEAR LOT ABOUT KIDS FEELING LIKE THEY HAD TO PARENT THE PARENTS AND THEN THIS WHOLE THING BECOMES PRETTY COMPLICATED SO WELL  THERE'S NO PERFECT WORLD WHERE ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO EVERY SINGLE TIME HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THIS BUSINESS OF MODELLING EMOTIONS AND ALSO ENCOURAGING KIDS TO BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS YEND I THINK EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT TO SHARE APPLIES YOU KNOW IN THE WORKPLACE RIGHT CAN A BOSS BE YOU KNOW REALLY UPSET IN FRONT OF THE PERSON THEY MANAGE MANAGEMENT RIGHT SO IT'S ALL THE SAME STUFF SO I GUESS ZOOMING OW AS A STAR EMOTIONS OUR NORMAL EMOTIONS ARE UNSTOPPABLE YOU CAN'T NOT FEEL SAD JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE ROOM RIGHT AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT KIND OF FORMS MY PERSPECTIVE IS IT'S REALLY HARD TO NOT SHOW SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE SAD YOU MIGHT THINK YOU'RE DOING THAT WELL BUT KIDS ARE EXTRA PERCEPTIVE THEY ARE ACTUALLY BUILT TO BE MOREE THAN WE ARE BECAUSE THEIR SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON ADULTS SO THEY HAVE TO ALWAYS NOTICE IS MY ADULT AROUND AS MY ADULT O K SO THEY REALLY ATTUNE TO WHAT'S GOING ON FOR US AND SO I THINK THE KIND OF QUESTION IS LESS DO I SHOW MY EMOTIONS TO MY KID OR NOT AND IT'S MORE O IF I'M SAD MY KID IS GOING TO NOTICE WHAT DO I DO THEN AND AS A PRINCIPLE ONE OF TH TINGS I THINK ABOUT OFTEN IS INFORMATION AND DOESN'T SCARE KIDS AS MUCH AS THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION SCARES KIDS SO LET'S SAY THERE'S LET'S SAY THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY AWFUL I DON'T KNOW AS A PARENT YOU'RE YOUR FAMILY MEMBER SOMEONE DIED OF CANCER I DON'T KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY HORRIBLE THAT YOU'VE JUST FOUND OUT RIGHT THERE'S WILDFIRES RIGHT NOW LET'S SAY YOU EVACUATED AND YOU FOUND OUT YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN YOU'RE SAD YOUR CHILD IS GOING TO NOTICE THAT AND YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO NO THAT YOU DON'T WANT YOUR KID TO BE A TEENAGER AND ADULT WHO GOES AROUND THE WORLD UNABLE TO PICK UP UNEMOTIONAL CUES FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT'S NOT ADAPTIVE AND SO THE PATTERNS WE SET WITH OUR KIDS WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG INFORM THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD WHEN THEY'RE OLDER AND SO HERE I AM LET'S SAY IT'S THE SITUATION OF SOMEBODY DYING AND I'M UPSET FIRST WALL IS A PARENT TELL YOURSELF IT'S NOT MY KID SEEING SAD THAT'S GOING TO D STABILIZE THEM IT'S SEEING ME SAD AND ME MAKING UP A BOGUS STORY OR DENYING IT BECAUSE THEN MY KID GOES PRETTY SURE MY MA WAS UPSET OH SHE'S NOT OH SHE'S PRETENDING LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED OH SHE LOOKS SAD BUT SHE'S SAYING SHE'S NOT SAD THAT IS REALLY UPSETTING IT WOULD BE LIKE HEARING YOUR BOSS SAY OH YOU TWENTY PER CENT LAOFS WHAT ARE WE DOING I DON'T KNOW OH EVERYTHING'S GREAT HOW ARE YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING SCURRY WHAT YOU'D WANT IS YOUR BOSS SAY YOU JUST HEARD SOMETHING YOU WERE RIGHT TO HEAR THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH A REALLY TOUGH TIME I'M STRESSED ABOUT IT THAT'S BY I YELLED YOU MIGHT BE STRESSED HERE'S WHAT I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH IT TOGETHER NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE HAS A CONTAINER IT HAS A STORY HUMANS NEED STORIES WE LIKE STORIES AND SO OFTEN WE THINK IT'S THE EMOTIONS THAT A KID IT'S THE LACK OF A STORY TO EXPLAIN IT SO LET'S SAY THIS REALLY DID HAPPEN PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY TO ME O K BUT DOCTOR BECKYK MY KID IS FOUR I MEANT TO SAY THAT THEIR AUNT DIED THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW CAMSER RA WE DON'T HAVE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE I CAN'T EVEN TELL O HOW MANY PARENTS I'VE SEEN WHOSE KIDS HAVE ALL OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE MADE UP STORIES I JUST SAID SHE WENT TO SLEEP FOR A WHILE SIX MONTHS LATER MY KID IS A LOT OF TROUBLE SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT YES THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR AUNT WHO WENT TO SLEEP ONE TIME CREKNOW CREATES HUGE ISSUE NO MATTER WHAT BOGA STORY YOU MAKE UP KIDS CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH AND THEY CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH WHEN IT'S TOLD TO THEM FROM A LOVING TRUSTED ADULT IT'S KIND OF LIKE ME AND YOU SOMEONE CAN TELL US A HARD TRUTH BUT IT'S FROM SOMEONE YOU FEEL SAFE WITH AND THAT YOU FEE LIKE ALSO BELIEVES IN YOU AND SAYS IT HONESTLY IT MIGHT BE HARD BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL AWFUL SO IT'S ABOUT SAYING TO YOUR KID YOU SAW ME CRYING ONE OF MY FAVORITE KIND OF SENTENCES SAY TO KIDS AROUND THIS AUSE I THINK IT REALLY BUILDS THEIR CONFIDENCE IS JUST YOU WERE RIGHT TO NOTICE THAT I WAS CRYING AND I'M FEELING SAD AND LOOK YOU SAW THAT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY MAKING THIS UP AUNT AUNT SALLY DIED DO YOU KNOW WHAT DYING MEANS DYING IS WHEN SOMEONE'S BODY STOPS WORKING THEN I'D PAUSE RI'D SWN BE A MONOLOGUE I'LL SEE HOW MY KID RESPONDS I MIGHT ADD I'M NOT DYING ACTUALLY REALLY NEED TO HEAR THAT IN HARD TIMES I'M NOT DYING NO ONE ELSE IS DYING I'M SAFE AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAD AND I'M STILL YOUR STRONG MAAM WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU THAT SETS THE STAGE FOR SUCH RESILIENCE AND IS KIND OF THE OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING'S FINE MY KID KEEPS SEEING ME CRYING THEY KEEP HEARING WORDS THEY'RE NOT USED TO HEARING DIE CANCER AUNT SALLY FUNERAL WHATEVER IT IS THAT",
