  "transcription": "AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR JORDAN PETERSON DOCTOR JORDAN PETERSON WELCOME THANK YOU SIR DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU HERE AND WANT TO TALK ABOUT ELEMENTS WITHIN YOUR NEW BOOK E ALSO SOME ELEMENTS WITHIN YOUR PREVIOUS BOOKS AND WITHIN THAT MIND OF YOURS GENERALLY AS A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT I'M WONDERING IF YOU WOULD TOLERATE OR PERMIT A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT A SORT OF BRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGY I'M JUST KING TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR ER WE MIGHT UM PROD SOME OF THE THEMES THAT YOU BRING UP RELATED TO THE BOOK SO I VIEW THE BRAIN AS OBVIOUSLY A BUNCH OF CELLS AND PARTS ET CETERA BUT I DISTIL IT DOWN TO SOME BASIC FEATURES FIRST WHILE WE HAVE AN AUTONOMIC PHYSIOLOGY I THINK WE'D BOTH AGREE ON THAT THAT REGULATES OUR SLEEPINESS AND WAKEFULNESS OUR BREATHING OUR HEART RATE STUFF THAT RUNS IN THE BACKGROUND AND THEN WE HAVE A LOT OF CIRCUITRY DEVOTED TO WHAT I WOULD CALL IMPULSES THINGS THAT WE DESIRE WE WANT TO MOVE TOWARD APPETITIVE BEHAVIORS AND WE ALSO HAVE SOME IMPULSES TO AVOID THINGS THAT ARE PUTRID PAINFUL ET CETERA THAT'S ALL IN THERE LIKE IT IS IN O WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF IMPULSE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THAT CHARACTERIZATION O BECAUSE THERE'S AN IMPORTANT THERE'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO BE MADE ON THE THERE YOU PAY A PRICE FOR CHARACTERIZING THAT AS IMPULSEND I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE IT'S CRUCIAL GREAT WE'LL CIRCLE BACK TO IMPULSE I'D LIKE TO DO THAT AND THEN WE HAVE A LOT OF CIRQUITRY PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT IT AS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION A PRE FRONTAL CIRCUITRY WHICH DOES MANY THINGS BUT I LIKE TO THINK OF I AS A CIRCUIT THAT CAN SAY AND HEAR I'M BORROWING FROM A PREVIOUS GUEST US AS A NEURO SURGEON IT CAN SAY  OR EXERT WHAT'S CALLED TOP DOWN SUPPRESSION ON THESE WHAT I'M CALLING IMPULSES IT CANSOUD TALK ABOUT THAT TOO THE SPPRESSION IDEA AND THE INHIBITION IDEA IN GENERAL GREAT BECAUSE THERE'S I THINK THERE'S A PARALLEL PROBLEM THERE TO THE NOTION OF IMPULSE THAT'S VERY MUCH WORTH DELVING INTO GREAT SO CIRCUITRY THAT'S DEVOTED TO OUR ABILITY TO SELF INHIBIT THE DESIRE TO REACH FOR SOMETHING OR TO AVOID SOMETHING WE CAN PUSH OURSELVES INTO THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVERSIVE WE CAN AVOID DOING THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DRIVE US TO JUST DO IT ANYWAY AND THEN WE HAVE WHAT I THINK OF AS OUR DEFAULT SETTINGS KIND OF HOW WE'RE OPERATING IN THE WORLD WITH RESPECT TO FOOD OTHER PEOPLE OUR VES OUR THOUGHTS IF WE DON'T INTERVENE WITH OURSELVES AND THESE DEFAULT SETTINGS ARE OF COURSE ESTABLISHED BY BOTH NATURE A GENETIC PROGRAMME THAT WIRES UP CIRCUETARY BUT ALSO NURTURE BECAUSE OF THE IMMENSE NERO PLASTICITY THAT OCCURS IN THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE YEARS PLUS OF LIFE BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE NEURO PLASTICITY THIS INCREDIBLE GIFT THAT HUMANS HAVE MORE OF THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES AS FAR AS WE KNOW WHICH IS WE CAN DECIDE TO MAKE CHANGES NOW THE REASON I LAY OUT THIS FRAMEWORK AS OPPOSED TO STARTING WITH A QUESTION IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY AMAZING QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK IN THIS BOOK YOU KNOW WE WHO WRESTLE WITH GOD ARE BEEN TRYING TO WRAP OUR ARMS AND MINDS AROUND THIS HUGE SET OF QUESTIONS AND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO STEP BACK FROM ALL THAT AND ASK IS PART OF THE REASON THAT WE HAVE A CONCEPT OF GOD THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE RELIGIONS IS THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF SOME HUMANS AT SOME POINT REALIZING OR PERHAPS GOD HIMSELF REALIZING THAT WHAT WE ARE EQUIPPED WITH AS HUMANS WHICH WE JUST DESCRIBED IS INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO EVOLVE AS A SPECIES AND BE THE BEST VERSION OF OURSELVES I THINK THIS FOR ME REALLY IS LIKE THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF AT LEAST MY LIFE WHICH IS TO WHAT EXTENT DO I NEED TO INTERVENE WITH MY DEFAULT SETTINGS REWIRE THEM ENGAGE THAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND  PUSH DOWN ON SOME APETED OR EVERSIVE BEHAVIOURS AND TO WHAT EXTENT CAN WE DO THAT MAYBE TO WHAT END AND TO WHAT END ITD MAYBE WE NEED A RULE BOOK YOU KNOW I I STARTING TO BELIEVE AND I'M NOW FORTY NINE YEARS OLD THAT WE NEED A RULE BOOK THAT THE NEURAL CIRCUETRY THAT'S ENCASED WITHIN OUR SKULLS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO NAVIGATE THROUGH LIFE WELL DO OUR BEST I MAN'T COME WE KIND OF KNOW THAT WE NEED A RULE BOOK EVENI YOU ADMITTED THAT IN SOME WAYS IMPLICITLY WHEN YOU DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE YEARS SOCIALIZATION WINDOW AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE HAVE TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND OUR TRADITIONS IN ORDER TO SET US RIGHT AND THAT'S SO COMPLEX IT TAKES TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND SO WE'RE LEARNING SOMETHING FROM THAT AND THAT'S INDICATION THAT OUR LET'S SAY DEFAULT BIOLOGICAL SETTINGS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO GUIDE US INTO THE FUTURE RIGHT AND SO THEN THE QUESTION ISL WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE LEARNING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT SOCIALIZATION CESS AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AND PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AS A SERIES OF COMPLEX INHIBITIONS OF LOWER ORDER MOTIVATIONAL STATES IMPULSES BUT I'M NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THE INHIBITION MODEL BECAUSE INHIBITION IS UNSOPHISTICATED SOCIALIZATION INTEGRATION IS SOPHISTICATED SOCIALIZATION SO HEE HERE'S A WAY OF I REALLY LEARNED THIS I THINK FROM CONTRASTING FREUD WITH PAGE BECAUSE FREUD'S MODEL SUPER EGO IS REALLY AN INHIBITION MODEL AND FREUD AS A NEUROLOGIST PGE'S MODEL WAS VERY DIFFERENT HE THOUGHT OF THE PROPERLY SOCIALIZED PERSON AS SOMEONE WHO HAD INTEGRATED THEIR LOWER ORDER WE'LL CALL THEM IMPULSES FOR NOW INTO A SUSTAINABLE VOLUNTARY STRUCTURE THAT REGULATED THEM AND GAVE THEM ALL THEIR PROPER PLACE THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN AN INEVETORY MODEL SO FOR EXAMPLEI GIVE YO AN EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN LIFE MY SON WAS QUITE AN AH WILFUL YOUNG CHILD WONDERING WHERE HE TOGED IT FROM THERE ENOUGH DAND MY FATHER WAS YOU KNO A FORMIDABLE CHARACTER AND SO MY SON LIKED TO DO WHAT HE LIKED TO DO AND IT TOOK HIM IT TOOK QUITE A BIT OF TUSSLING WITH HIM TO HELP HIM I WOULDN'T SAY INHIBIT THAT OR REGULATE TO INTEGRATE IT AND ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT WAS HE BECAME A VERY GOOD ATHLETE AND SO WHY IS THAT RELEVANT WELL BECAUSE IT WASN'T LIKE HE STOPPED BEING ASSERTIVE OR EVEN AGGRESSIVE IT'SH HE LEARNED HOW TO PUT THAT AGGRESSION IN ITS PROPER PLACE IN RELATIONSHIP TO A GOAL THAT WAS MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN MERELY GETTING HIS OWN WAY MOMENT TO MOMENT OK SO INTEGRATIONS A BETTER LIKE A VERY SOPHISTICATED ATHLETE A TEAM ATHLETE IN PARTICULAR ISN'T NOT AGGRESSIVE AND THEY'RE NOT INHIBITING THEIR AGGRESSION ON THE PLAYING FIELD THEY MAY NOW AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE PROVOKED LET'S SAY BUT ALL THINGS CONSIDERED WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS SUBORDINATE THEIR AGGRESSION TO A HIGHER ORDER GOAL THAT ENABLES THEM TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL BUT ALSO TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A MAXIMAMLY SOCIAL AND SUSTAINABLE WAY AND PAGE'S POINT AND HEIS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THIS IS THAT THAT'S MUCH BETTER CONCEPTUALIZED AS INTEGRATION AND THEN WITH REGARD TO IMPULSE CAUSE I SAID I WOULD RETURN TO THAT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WALKING THROUGH THE BEHAVIOR F LITERATURE A LOT OF THAT WAS DERIVED FROM ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS AND IT WAS PREDICATED ON THE IDEA THAT IF YOU COULD PLAIN SOMETHING ON THE BASIS OF A DETERMINISTIC REFLEX YOU SHOULD AND THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT HYPOTHESIS DON'T MAKE YOUR THEORY ANY MORE COMPLEX THAN IT NEEDS TO BE HOW FAR CAN YOU GET WITH A THEORY OF CHAINED REFLEXIS A DETERMINISTIC THEORY THE BEHAVIOR HAS GOT A LONG WAY THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE HIGHEST STRATA OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR WITH A CHAINED REFLEX THEORY BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS THEY DID THAT WERE VERY GOOD BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE ABOUT WAS TO CONCEPTUALIZE MOTIVATION STATES LET'S SAY AS IMPULSES OR DRIVES THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT FAILS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF THOSE STATES ON PERCEPTION SO IT'S MUCH BETTER TO THINK OF A MOTIVATED STATE THIS IS WHAT HELPED ME INTEGRATE BEHAVIOR THEORY WITH PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY ESPECIALLY THE PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY OF RELIGIOUS ENDEAVOR IT'S MUCH BETTER TO THINK OF THOSE LOWER ORDER MOTIVATIONAL STATES AS PERSONALITIES THEYR PERSONALITIES THEY HAVE THEIR PERCEPTIONS THEY HAVE THEIR OBJECTS OF PERCEPTION THEY HAVE THEIR A COGNITIVE RATIONALIZATIONS YOU CERTAINLY SEE THAT IN EDDICTION LET'S SAY THEY HAVE THEIR EMOTIONS LIKE THEY ARE SMALL PERSONALITIES UNIDIMENSIONAL VERY NARROW MINDED PERSONALITIES BUT THEIR PERSONALITIES THEYRE NOT IMPULSES SO ARE THEY PERSONALITIS WITHIN ARE WHAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK OF AS OUR LARGER PERSONALITY I MEAN WHAT I'M HERE AS THAT LET'S BODY'S AN ADDECT IT DEPENDS ON HOW INTEGRATED YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU COULD BE NOTHING BUT A SUCCESSION OF DOMINION OF SUB PERSONALITIES THAT'S WHAT A TWO YEAR OLD IS RIGHT AND SO YOU HAVE TO BUILD AN INTEGRATING PERSONALITY ON TOP OF THOSE SUB PERSONALITIES BUT NOT IN A MANNER THAT INHIBITS THEM THAT MEANS YOUR SOCIALIZATION IS IUNSOPHISTICATED EVEN FREUD KNEW THIS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BASICALLY AN INHIBITORY MODEL OF SUPEREGO REGULATION A HE BELIEVED THAT A HEALTHY PERSONALITY WOULD HAVE THE IMPULSE OF AGGRESSION AND THE IMPULSE OF SEXUALITY TO TAKE TWO MAJOR LOWER ORDER MOTIVATIONAL STATES INTO ACCOUNT WOULD HAVE THEM INTEGRATED INTO THE FUNCTIONING EGO THE ISSUE IS INTEGRATION AND SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU'RE SOCIAL LIKE OK WHEN MY SON FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BECOME WILFUL IN A MANNER THAT I REGARDED AS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE FOR HIM AND THE HOUSE",
