  "transcription": "AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR LARRY SANTOS DOCTOR LARRY SANTOS WELCOME THANKS FOR SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME ON THE SHOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS THING THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO WANT BUT MOST EVERYONE HAS TROUBLE KEEPING THEMSELVES IN A STATE OF HAPPINESS WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD EVEN BE SEEKING TO CONSTANTLY BE IN A STATE OF HAPPINESS BUT JUST TO SIT BACK FROM THAT QUESTION FOR A MOMENT HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENM TIONS AND THIS THING THAT WE CALL COGNITION BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DAY IS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FEELINGS THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS AND AS NERO SCIENTISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS ET CETERA WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMOTIONS AND COGNITION AND MAYBE WHERE THEY OVERLAP SO IF YOU COULD EDUCATE US A BIT ON THAT I THINK THAT WILL SET THE STAGE NICELY FOR UNDERSTANDING HAPPINESS WELL I'M GLAD YOU STARTED THERE ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE VERY DEFINITION OF HAPPINESS I THINK A SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TEND TO THINK ABOUT IT INCLUDES BOTH OF THESE PARTS RIGHT SO I THINK SOCIAL SCIENTISTS TEND TO THINK ABOUT HAPPINESS AS BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE AND BEING HAPPY WITH YOUR LIFE SO BEING HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE IS SORT OF THE EMOTION SIDE IHT A DECENT NUMBER OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS MAYBE SLIGHTLY LESS NEGATIVE EMOTIONS LIKE YOU EXISTING IN YOUR LIFE FEELS GOOD THAT'S KIND OF AN EMOTIONAL PART RIGHT A BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO KIND OF HOW YOU THINK YOUR LIFE IS GOING DO YOU HAVE A PURPOSE OR YOU KIND OF HAPPY WITH HOW THINGS ARE GOING IT'S HOW YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE WHICH IS A SORT OF COGNITIVE THING AND SO EVEN THE EARLIEST SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WHO STARTED THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS AT THE TIME THEY CALL IT SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING I THINK PSYCHOLOGIST RE LIKE WO HAPPINESS TOWNS SOUNDS TOO WOOY LIKE WE'LL CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE BUT IT MEANS EXACTLY THE SAME THING IT MEANS SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING RIGHT WHEN THEY START TO THINKG ABOUT SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING THEY DIVIDED IT INTO THIS SORT OF AFFECTIVE EMOTIONAL PART WHICH IS LIKE HOW YOU FEEL IN YOUR LIFE BUT ALSO THIS COGNITIVE PART HOW YOU THINK YOUR LIFE IS GOING SO THAT BASIC DICODOMY HAS BEEN THERE SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF FOLKS STUDYING HAPPINESS SCIENTIFICALLY I'M ALREADY STRUCK BY THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN YOUR LIFE VERSUS WITH YOUR LIFE A ONE REQUIRES A A KIND OF FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCING OF LIFE IN YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW YOU WAKE UP FEELING GOOD ARE YOU FEELING GOOD WITH YOUR INSIDE OF YOUR FRIENDSHIPS AND OTHER RELATIONSHIPS FAMILY ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP SCHOOL WORK THE OTHER INVOLVES A BIT OF A THIRD PERSONING OF SELFO LOOKING AT ONE'S AM C V EITHER ACTUAL C V OR AM REFLECTED C THROUGH THE LENS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND KIND OF GETTING A SENSE LIKE AM I DOING WELL AM I NOT DOING WELL AM I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IF I MAY IS TO BE HAPPY IN YOUR LIFE REGARDLESS OF THE THIRD PERSONING PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT DOING DAMAGE TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAPPINESS AND LIFEWE I THINK I DEALT IT'D BE NICE TO DO BOTH RIGHT AND I THINK THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THESE THINGS DISSOCIATE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW YOU INTERACT WITH LOTS OF INTERESTING RICH PEOPLE OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK A LOT OF THEM HAVE IT KIND OF IN THEIR LIFE FEELS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT THEY HAVE LOTS OF HEDONIC PLEASURES THA DRINKING NICE WINE HANGING OTBOY AMAZ HOW MUCH HOW MUCH I'M HOW MUCH SUFFERING THEY REPORT AH THAT'S INTREST IAING HOW MUCH SUFFERING THEY REPORT SO THIS IS THE QUESTION IS IS IS THIS SORT OF COGNITIVE PART THE LIKE THIRD PERSON PART OR IS IT THE REPORTING PART AND I THINK WHEN THE PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE THINKING ABOUT IT THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS THE REPORTING PART RIGHT ANDAND THIS GETS TRICKY RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SEE FOLKS HAVING THEIR NICE GLASS OF WINE ON THE BEACH AND I'M THINKING LIKE THAT'S WITH LOTS OF POSITIVE EMOTION LIKE I BET IF I TESTED THEM AND COULD HAVE A DIRECT LOOK AT THEIR SENSORY EXPERIENCE AND PROBABLY BE PRETTY POSITIVE IT'S ONLY WHEN THEY REFLECT ON THEIR LIFE AND THEIR ASKING WHALL HOW'S IT GOING THAT THEY SAY ALL AND I DON'T KNOW MY STOCKS WENT DOWN ORE LIKE WHEN I HEAR ABOUT A LACK OF HAPPINESS LET ME THINK OF SOME OF THE KIND OF BULLET POINT ONES THAT SEEM TO COME UP REPETIVELY THEY ARE INDEED NOT RELATED TO LACK OF RESOURCES I DON'T HEAR THAT WHAT I'VE HEARD AND THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR WHERE I D PART OF MY TIME IN WEAR I GREW UP WHICH IS IN SELICON VALLEY WHICH IS ALSO NOT EVERYONE BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WHO HAVE A CRUDE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WEALTH THE MEAN IS SHIFTED VERY HIGH AND HENCE THE COST OF LIVING A BUT IT'S OFTEN CONCERNS ABOUT AM THEY'RE KIDS OR THEIR MOTHER IS ILL THEIR CHILD IS STRUGGLING IN A PARTICULAR WAY A VERY OFTEN THAT'S WHAT IT IS THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OF WELL BEING IN THEIR KIDS RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OR PHYSICAL HEALTH OR OTHER RELATIVES MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH OR THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING POLITICALLY BUT WE WON'T GE GYWEO THERE YET NO I THINK THIS IS TRUE RIGHT YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF OUR HAPPINESS IS MADE UP OF THE HAPPINESS OF OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT EM BOTH KIND OF HOW THEY'RE DOING AND HOW WE THINK THEY'RE DOING COGNITIVELY BUT LITERALLY JUST EMOTIONALLY RIGHT YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN AROUND A FAMILY MEMBER OR A SPOUSE WHO WAS INCREDIBLY PISSED OFF Y SAD IT'S'S INCREDIBLY HARD NOT TO CATCH THOSE EMOTIONS YOURSELF AND WE PSYCHOLOGISTS KNOW HOW THESE PROCESSES WORK RITES THIS PROCESSOR EMOTIONAL CONTAGION WEREYOU'RE LITERALLY CATCHING THE EMOTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND SO OFTENTIMES THE THINGS THAT YOU MOST WORRY ABOUT TO BE HAPPY YOURSELF IS FOCUSING ON THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU BECAUSE THAT LITERALLY BECOMES YOUR HAPPINESS AT A VERY FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL 'M PAUSING JUST TO THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE AS WE GROW UP AMEN I REALIZE IT VARIES BY PLACE AND LOTS OF CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AS WE GROW UP WE ARE TAUGHT TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW OUR LIFE IS GOING A BIT FROM THE OUTSIDE WE GAIN EVALUATIONS STARTING REALLY YOUNG ILE STARS ON OUR PICTURES OR A GOOD JOB OR NOWADAYS THEY SAY GREAT EFFORT IN DRAWING THIS OLD THING THE GROWTH MINES ATA LANGUAGE A BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IN THE UNITED STATES WE ARE TAUGHT TO THINK ABOUT BEING HAPPY IN OUR RIGHT AS KIDS I THINK ALL KIDS ALL MAMMALS SEEM TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS UM JOYFUL EXPERIENCES FOR THEM PLAYING IS ALMOST ALWAYS AN INNATE U JOYFUL EXPERIENCE BUT THEN AS THE EVALUATION START COMING IN WE GET BETTER AND BETTER AT ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND WHERE WE ARE AM RELATIVE TO THE SORT OF STANDARD GOALS OF THE THIRD GRADE THE FIFTH GRADE THE TWELFTH GRADE AH BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVER SAT ME DOWN AND SAID A HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EVALUATE IF YOU'RE FEELING GOOD IN YOUR LIFE LIKE THAT YOU'RE SAVORING YOUR SOCKER GAME THAT YOU'RE SAVORING YOUR TIME WITH FRIENDS THAT WAS NEVER NEVER TAUGHT TO ME YES AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL DANGER OF THESE KIND OF EXTRINSIC REWARDS AS YOU MIGHT CALL THEM ALL THE STUFF OUTSIDE THE GRADES YOU KNOW THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND SO ON LITERALLY STEALING YOUR INTRINSIC REWARDS A THERE'S THIS FUNNY PHENOMENA IN PSYCHOLOGY WHERE IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S INTRINSICALLY REWARDING SO LET'STAY EXERCISE RIGHT LIKE I WANT TO GO OUT YOU KNOW TO RUN LIKE A BONTRAY I LOVE RUNNING I GET THIS INTRINSIC REWARD FROM RUNNING NOW I GET SOME SORT OF TOOL WHETHER IT'S MY WATCH OR SOMETHING I'M SCRIBBLING DOWN IN A PHONE AP AND I HAVE TO LICK LOG MY RUNNING NOW IT BECOMES A SORT OF EXTRINSIC REWARD IT'S NOT JUST LIKE THE FEELING OF RUNNING BUT IT SORT OF TAKES ON THIS EXTRINSIC IDEA AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETIMES WE END UP GOING FOR THAT REWARD ANYWAY I THE FICTION WRITER DAVID SIDARIS HAS THIS WONDERFUL ARTICLE CALLED THE FIT BIT LIFE WHERE HE TALK ABOUT HOW YOU WANTED TO GET FIT IT'S IN INTRINSIC REWARD OF YOUR EXERCISING MORE AND HE GOT THE FIT BIT AND THEN IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE FIT PIT AND HE WOULD SET THE LEVEL HIGHER AND SET THE LEVEL HIGHER AND HE HIMSELF WAS MISERABLE AND NO LONGER ENJOYING RUNNING TO THE POINT THAT LIKE AT SOME BOY HE JUST WOULD WALK AROUND YOURE SHAKING HIS ARM JUST TO GET UP TO THOSE FINAL STEPS RIGHT THAT'S A REALLY TERRIBLE CASE WHERE YOUR EXTRINSIC REWARD WINDS UP TAKING OVER BUT SO MANY O THE CASES YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT ARE ONES IN OUR REAL LIFE WHERE THAT COMES UP MUCH MORE INSIDIOUSLY THAN WOULD LIKE A FIT BIT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT PLAY IN MAMMALS THE EASY THING THAT LITTLE KID ANIMALS DO ALL OVER THE PLACE LITTLE KID HUMANS DON'T DO THAT AS MUCH ANY MORE BECAUSE EVEN FROM REALLY YOUNG AGES THEY'RE YOU KNOW IN TODDLER YOU KNOW UNIVERSITY WHERE THEY'RE KIND OF LEARNING THINGS TO GET INTO THE NEXT GRADE AND GET THO PERFECT GRADE SO THEY CAN GET INTO INSTITUTIONS LIKE OURS RIGHTIT ALL BECOMES ABOUT EXTRINSIC REWARDS AND SO I THINK YOU'RE REALLY RIGHT WE'RE KIND OF EXTRINSIC SIZING ALL THE REWARDS TO THE POINT THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING TO INTERNAL HAPPINESS IT WAS HARD ALREADY TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT STUFF BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THIS IT'S TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT YOUR EMOTIONS YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I THINK IT'S GOTTEN EVEN HARDER BECAUSE WE HAVE THESEMETRICS THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND OUR CULTURE BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT THE INTRINSIC THING THERE'S SOME  EXTRINSIC MARKER THAT COULD MAKE THE INTRINSIC THING EVEN LESS FUN FOR PEOPLE THAT A GROW UP OR LIVE IN AREAS WHERE WELL LET'S JUST SAY THAT HAT HAVE LESS AM DISPOSABLE WEALTH  IS THERE THERE MUST BE DATA ON SORT OF AM RELATIONSHIP TO INTRINSIC VERSUS EXTRINSIC FORCES ON HAPPINESS I MEAN I CAN MAKE UP ALL SORTS OF STORIES IN MY HEAD ABOUT HOW PEOPLE STARTING OUT FROM VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE MORE OR LESS HAPPY BUT WHAT OR THE DATA SAY YES THESE EFFECTS OF KIND OF RESOURCES ON HAPPINESS ARE REALLY INTERESTING AND THEY'R NEW AN STRAIGHT SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOWER END OF THE KIND OF INCOME SPECTRUM YOU WOULD OBVIOUSLY SAY THAT MONEY AFFECTS HAPPINESS RIGHT IF YOU CAN'T PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE IF YOU CAN'T PUT A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD DEFINITELY GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE IS GOING TO AFFECT YOUR HAPPINESS IN A POSITIVE WAY AND THE DATA SORT OF BEAR THIS OUT UM THIS  THERE'S A VERY FAMOUS STUDY BY THEA NO BELL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST DANNY CONOMAN R I P IM BACK IN TWENTY TEN YOU DID THIS COOL STUDY WHERE HE LOOKED AT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN INCOME AND HAPPINESS AS REPORTED IN HOW MUCH STRESS YOU HAVE UM HOW MUCH POSITIVE EMOTION YOU EXPERIENCE AND SO ON ANT THE LOW END OF THE INCOME SCALES IT JUST GOES UP AND UP AND UP RIGHT MORE MONEY JUST ALMOST LINEALLY GIVES YOU MORE HAPPINESS BUT WHAT DANNY FOUND INDIS THE SECOND PART OF THIS NUANCE PICTURE",
