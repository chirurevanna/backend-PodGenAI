  "transcription": "You've launched a lot of companies and built a lot of products. As you say, most failed, but some succeeded. What's your philosophy behind building the startups that you did? I think my philosophy is very different than most people in startups because most people in startups, they. They build a company and they raise money, right? And they hire people and then they build a product and they find something that makes money. And I don't really raise money, I don't use VC funding. I do everything myself. I'm a designer, I'm the developer. I make everything, I make the logo. So for me, I'm much more scrappy. And because I don't have funding, I need to go fast, I need to make things fast to see if an idea works. I have an idea in my mind and I build it. Build it like a mini startup and I launch it very quickly, within two weeks or something of building it. And I check if there's demand and if people actually sign up, and not just sign up, but if people actually pay money, they need to take out their credit cards, pay me money, and then I can see if the idea is."
