  "transcription": "What to you is the probability that super intelligent AI will destroy all human civilization? What's the time frame? Let's say 100 years, in the next hundred years. So the problem of controlling AGI or superintelligence, in my opinion, is like a problem of creating a perpetual safety machine by analogy with perpetual motion machine. It's impossible. Yeah, we may succeed and do a good job with GPT 5, 6, 7, but they just keep improving, learning, eventually self modifying, interacting with the environment, interacting with malevolent actors. The difference between cybersecurity, narrow AI safety and safety for general AI for superintelligence is that we don't get a second chance with cybersecurity. Somebody hacks your account, what's the big deal? You get a new password, new credit card, you move on Here. If we're talking about existential risks, you only get one chance. So you're really asking me what are the chances that will create the most complex software ever on a first try with zero bugs? And it will continue have zero bugs for 100 years or more. So there is an incremental improvement of systems leading up to AGI, to you, it doesn't matter if we can keep those safe. There's going to be one level of system at which you cannot possibly control it. I don't think we so far have made any system safe at the level of capability they display. They already have made mistakes. We had accidents, they've been jailbroken. I don't think there is a single large language model today which no one was successful at making do something developers didn't intend it to do. But there's a difference between getting it to do something unintended, getting it to do something that's painful, costly, destructive, and something that's destructive to the level of hurting billions of people, or hundreds of millions of people, billions of people, or the entirety of human civilization. That's a big leap. Exactly. But the systems we have today have capability of causing X amount of damage. So when they fail, that's all we get. If we develop systems capable of impacting all of humanity, all of universe, the damage is proportionate. What do you are the possible ways that such kind of mass murder of humans can happen? It's always a wonderful question. So one of the chapters in my new book is about unpredictability. I argue that we cannot predict what a smarter system will do. So you're really not asking me how superintelligence will kill everyone, you're asking me how I would do it. And I think it's not that interesting. I can tell you about a standard nanotech synthetic bionuclear superintelligence will come up with something completely new, completely super. We may not even recognize that as a possible path to achieve that goal. So there is like an unlimited level of creativity in terms of how humans could be killed. But, you know, we could still investigate possible ways of doing it. Not how to do it, but the. At the end, what is the methodology that does it? You know, shutting off the power and then humans start killing each other. Maybe because the resources are really constrained that there. Then there's the actual use of weapons, like nuclear weapons or developing artificial pathogens, viruses, that kind of stuff. We could still kind of think through that and defend against it, right? There's a ceiling to the creativity of mass murder of humans here, right? The options are limited. They are limited by how imaginative we are. If you are that much smarter, that much more creative, you are capable of thinking across multiple domains, do novel research in physics and biology, you may not be limited by those tools. If squirrels were planning to kill humans, they would have a set of possible ways of doing it, but they would never consider things we can come up with. So are you thinking about mass murder and destruction of human civilization? Are you thinking of. With squirrels? You put them in a zoo and they don't really know they're in a zoo. If we just look at the entire set of undesirable trajectories, majority of them are not going to be death. Most of them are going to be just like things like Brave New World where, you know, the squirrels are fed dopamine and they're all like doing some kind of fun activity and the sort of the fire, the soul of humanity is lost because of the drug that's fed to it. Or like literally in a zoo, we're in a zoo, we're doing our thing. We're like playing a game of Sims and the actual players playing that game are AI systems. Those are all undesirable because sort of the free will, the fire of human consciousness is dimmed through that process, but it's not killing humans. So are you thinking about that or is the biggest concern literally the extinctions of humans? I think about a lot of things. So there is X risk, existential risk, everyone's dead. There is S risk, suffering risks, where everyone wishes they were dead. We have also idea for Iris Ikigai risks where we lost our meaning. The systems can be more creative, they can do all the jobs. It's not obvious what you have to contribute To a world where superintelligence exists. Of course, you can have all the variants you mentioned, where we are safe, we are kept alive, but we are not in control. We are not deciding anything. We are like animals in a zoo. There is again, possibilities we can come up with as very smart humans, and then possibilities something a thousand times smarter can come up with for reasons we cannot comprehend. I would love to sort of dig into each of those. X risk S risk and I risk. So can you, like, linger on? Irisk what is that? So Japanese concept of ikigai, you find something which allows you to make money, you are good at it, and the society says we need it. So, like, you have this awesome job, you are podcaster, gives you a lot of meaning. You have a good life, I assume you're happy. That's what we want most people to find, to have. For many intellectuals, it is their occupation which gives them a lot of meaning. I am a researcher, philosopher, scholar. That means something to me. In a world where an artist is not feeling appreciated because his art is just not competitive with what is produced by machines or writer or scientist will lose a lot of that. And at the lower level, we're talking about complete technological unemployment. We're not losing 10% of jobs, we're losing all jobs. What do people do with all that free time? What happens then? Everything society is built on is completely modified in one generation. It's not a slow process where we get to kind of figure out how to live that new lifestyle, but it's pretty quick. In that world, can't humans do what humans currently do with chess? Play each other, have tournaments? Even though AI systems are far superior at this time in chess, so we just create artificial games. Or for us, they're real, like the Olympics. And we do all kinds of different competitions and have fun, maximize the fun and let the AI focus on the productivity. It's an option. I have a paper where I try to solve the value alignment problem for multiple agents. And the solution to avoid compromise is to give everyone a personal virtual unit universe. You can do whatever you want in that world. You could be king, you could be slave, you decide what happens. So it's basically a glorified video game where you get to enjoy yourself and someone else takes care of your needs. And the substrate alignment is the only thing we need to solve. We don't have to get 8 billion humans to agree on anything. So, okay, so why is that not a likely outcome? Why can't AI systems create video games for us to lose ourselves in each with an individual video game universe. Some people say that's what happened. We're in a simulation and we're playing that video game. And now we're creating what maybe we're creating artificial threats for ourselves to be scared about. Because fear is really exciting. It allows us to play the video game more vigorously. And some people choose to play on a more difficult level with more constraints. Some say, okay, I'm just going to enjoy the game. High privilege level. Absolutely. So, okay, what was that paper on multi agent value alignment? Personal universes. Personal universes. So that's one of the possible outcomes. But what in general is the idea of the paper? So it's looking at multiple agents that are human AI. Like a hybrid system. Whether it's humans and AIs or is it looking at humans or just so this is intelligent agents in order to solve value alignment problem. Trying to formalize it a little better. Usually we're talking about getting AIs to do what we want, which is not well defined. Are we talking about creator of a system, owner of that AI, humanity as a whole. But we don't agree on much. There is no universally accepted ethics, morals across.",
