  "transcription": "You mentioned something on a stream about the philosophical nature of time. So let's start with a wild question. Do you think time is an illusion? You know, I sell phone calls to comma for a thousand dollars. And some guy called me and like, you know, it's a thousand dollars. You can talk to me for, for half an hour. And he's like, yeah, okay, so like, time doesn't exist. And I really wanted to share this with you. I'm like, oh, what do you mean time doesn't exist? Right. Like, I think time is a useful model whether it exists or not. Right. Like, does quantum physics exist? Well, it doesn't matter. It's about whether it's a useful model to describe reality. Is time maybe compressive? Do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models? Like, underneath it all, is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for? I don't know. I was hoping you would know. I don't think it matters. I mean, this kind of connects to the models of constructive reality with machine learning. Right? Sure. Like, is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it? So there are things that are real. Kolmograph. Complexity is real. Yeah. Yeah. The compressive math is real. Yeah. Should be a T shirt. And I think hard things are actually hard. I don't think P equals np. Ooh, strong words. Well, I think that's the majority. I do think factoring is in P, but I don't think you're the person that follows the majority in all walks of life, so. But it's good for that one. I do. Yeah. In theoretical computer science, you're one of the sheep. All right. But to you, time is a useful model. Sure. What were you talking about on the stream with time? Are you made of time? If I remembered half the things I said on stream, someday someone's going to make a model of all of it and it's going to come back to haunt me someday soon. Yeah, probably. Would that be exciting to you or sad that there's a George Hot's model? I mean, the question is when the George Hots model is better than George Hotz? Like, I am declining and the model is growing. What is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that if you're competing with yourself, maybe you can just play a game where you have the George Hots answer and the George Hots model answer and ask which people prefer, people close to you or strangers? Either one. It will hurt more when it's people close to me. But both will be overtaken by the George Hots model. It'd be quite painful, right? Loved ones family members would rather have the model over for Thanksgiving than you. Yeah. Or like significant others would rather sexed with the, with the large language model version of you, especially when it's fine tuned to their preferences. Yeah, well, that's what we're doing in a relationship, Right. We're just fine tuning ourselves, but we're inefficient with it because we're selfish in greedy and so on. Language models can fine tune more efficiently, more selflessly. There's a Star Trek Voyager episode where Katherine Janeway, lost in the Delta Quadrant, makes herself a lover on the holodeck and the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit and Janeway edits the program to remove that. And then of course the realization is, wait, this person's terrible. It is actually all there nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that, that make this relationship worthwhile. But I don't think we're going to realize that until it's too late. Well, I think a large language model could incorporate the, the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff. Just the perfect amount of quirks and floor flaws to make you charming without crossing the line. Yeah, yeah. And that's probably a good like, approximation of the like the percent of time. The language model should be cranky or an asshole or jealous or all this kind of stuff. And of course it can and it will. But all that difficulty at that point is artificial. There's no more real difficulty. Okay, what's the difference between real and artificial? Artificial difficulty is difficulty that's like constructed or could be turned off with a knob. Real difficulty is like you're in the woods and you got to survive. So if something cannot be turned off with a knob is real? Yeah, I think so. Or I mean, you can't get out of this by smashing the knob with a hammer. I mean, maybe you kind of can, you know, into the wild when, you know, Alexander Supertramp. He wants to explore something that's never been explored before. But it's the nineties. Everything's been explored. So he's like, well, I'm.",
