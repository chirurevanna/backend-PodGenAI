  "transcription": "Take me through the OpenAI board saga that started on Thursday, November 16, maybe Friday, November 17 for you. That was definitely the most painful professional experience of my life and chaotic and shameful and upsetting and a bunch of other negative things. There were great things about it too, and I wish it had not been in such an adrenaline rush that I wasn't able to stop and appreciate them at the time. But I came across this old tweet of mine or this tweet of mine from that time period, which was like. It was like kind of going to your own eulogy, watching people say all these great things about you, and just like unbelievable support from people I love and care about. That was really nice. That whole weekend, I kind of like felt, with one big exception, I felt a great deal of love and very little hate. Even though it felt like I just. I have no idea what's happening and what's going to happen here. And this feels really bad. And there were definitely times I thought it was going to be one of the worst things to ever happen for AI safety. I also think I'm happy that it happened relatively early. I thought at some point between when OpenAI started and when we created AGI, there was going to be something crazy and explosive that happened. But there may be more crazy and explosive things still to happen. It's still, I think, helped us build up some resilience and be ready for more challenges in the future. But the thing you had a sense that you would experience is some kind of power struggle. The road to AGI should be a giant power struggle, like the world should. Well, not. Should I expect that to be the case. And so you have to go through that, like you said, iterate as often as possible in figuring out how to have a board structure, how to have organization, how to have the kind of people that you're working with, how to communicate all that in order to de escalate the power struggle as much as possible, pacify it. But at this point, it feels, you know, like something that was in the past that was really unpleasant and really difficult and painful. But we're back to work and things are so busy and so intense that I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it. There was a time after there was like this fugue state for kind of like the month after, maybe 45 days after that was. I was just sort of like drifting through the days. I was so out of it. I was feeling so down. Just on a personal psychological level. Yeah, really painful and hard to, like, have to keep running OpenAI in the middle of that, I just wanted to like crawl into a cave and kind of recover for a while. But, you know, now it's like we're just back to working on the mission. Well, it's still useful to go back there and reflect on board structures, on power dynamics, on how companies are run, the tension between research and product development and money and all this kind of stuff. So that you, who have a very high potential of building AGI, would do so in a slightly more organized, less dramatic way in the future. So there's value there to go. Both the personal, psychological aspects of you as a leader and also just the board structure and all this kind of messy stuff. Definitely learned a lot about structure and incentives and what we need out of a board. And I think it is valuable that this happened now in some sense. I think this is probably not like the last high stress moment of OpenAI, but it was quite a high stress moment. My company very nearly got destroyed and we think a lot about many of the other things we've got to get right for AGI, but thinking about how to build a resilient org and how to build a structure that will stand up to a lot of pressure in the world, which I expect more and more as we get closer, I think that's super important. Do you have a sense of how deep and.",
