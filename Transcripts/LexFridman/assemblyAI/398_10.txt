  "transcription": "This is so great. Lighting change. Wow. Yeah. We can put the light anywhere and it doesn't feel awkward to be really close to you. No, it does. I actually moved you. I moved you back a few feet before you got into the headset. You were like, right here. I don't know if people can see this, but this is incredible. The realism here is just incredible. Where am I? Where are you, Mark? Where are we? You're in Austin, right? No, I mean, this place. We're shrouded by darkness with ultra realistic face, and it just feels like we're in the same room. This is really the most incredible thing I've ever seen. And sorry to be in your personal space. I mean, we have done jiu jitsu before. Yeah, no, I was. I was commenting to the team before that even that. I feel like we've choked each other from further distances than it feels like we are right now. I mean, this is just really incredible. I don't know how to describe with words. It really feels like. It feels like we're in the same room. Yeah. Feels like the future. This is truly, truly incredible. I just wanted to take it in. I'm still getting used to it. It's like, it's you. It's really you, but you're not here with me. Right. You're there wearing a headset and I'm wearing a headset. It's. It's really, really incredible. So what can you describe what it takes currently for us to appear so photorealistic to each other? Yeah. So, I mean, for. For background, we both did these scans for this research project that we have at Meta called Kodak Avatars. And the idea is that instead of our avatars being cartoony and instead of actually transmitting a video, what it does is we've sort of scanned ourselves and a lot of different expressions and we've built a computer model of sort of each of our faces and bodies and the different expressions that we make and collapse that into a codec that then when you have the headset on your head, it sees your face, it sees your expression, and it can basically send an encoded version of what you're supposed to look like over the wire. So in addition to being photorealistic, it's also actually much more bandwidth efficient than transmitting a full video or especially a 3D immersive video of a whole scene like this. And it captures everything, like, the flaws, like, to me, the subtleties of the human face, like, even the flaws, that's like, that's all amazing. It makes you. It makes it so much more immersive. It makes you realize that like perfection isn't the thing that leads to immersion. It's like the little subtle flaws like freckles and like variations in color and just. Yeah. Wrinkles. All stuff. Yeah. Asymmetry. And just the different, like the corners of the eyes, like what your eyes do when you smile. All that kind of stuff. Yeah. Eyes are a huge part of it. Yeah. I mean there's all the studies that most of communication, even when people are speaking is not actually the words that they're saying. Right. It's kind of the expression and all that. So. And we try to capture that with the kind of classical expressive avatar system that we have that's the kind of more cartoon designed one. You can kind of put those kind of expressions on those faces as well. But there's obviously a certain realism that comes with delivering kind of this photorealistic experience that. I don't know, I just think it's really magical. I mean, this gets to kind of the core of what the vision around virtual and augmented reality is of. Like delivering a sense of presence as if you're there together, no matter where you actually are in the world. And I mean, this, this experience, I think is a good embodiment of that where it's like. I mean, we're in two completely different states halfway across the country and it just like, you know, looks like you're just sitting right in front of me. It's. It's pretty wild. Yeah, Yeah. I can't, it's. I'm almost getting emotional. It's like. It feels like a totally. It's fundamentally new experience. Like for me to have this kind of conversation with loved ones, it would just change everything. Maybe just to elaborate. So I went to Pittsburgh and went to the whole scanning procedure, which has so much incredible technology, so software and hardware going on. But it is a lengthy process. So what's your vision for the future of this in terms of making this more accessible to people? You know, it starts off with a small number of people doing these very detailed scans. Right. Which is. That's the version that you did and that I did. And before there were a lot of people who we've done this kind of a scan for. We probably need to kind of over collect expressions when we're doing the scanning because we haven't figured out how much we can reduce that down to a really streamlined process and extrapolate from the scans that have already been done. But you know, the goal. And we have a project that's Working on this already is just to do a very quick scan with your cell phone, where you just take your phone, kind of wave it in front of your face for a couple of minutes, you know, say a few sentences, make a bunch of expressions, but overall have the whole process just be two to three minutes, and then produce something that's of the quality of what we have right now. So I think that that's one of the big challenges that remains. And right now we have the ability to do the scans if you, you know, have hours to sit for one. And with today's technology, I mean, you're using a meta headset that exists. It's a product that's kind of for sale now. You can drive these with that. But the production of, of these scans in a very efficient way is one of the last pieces that we still need to really nail. And then obviously there's all the experiences around it. I mean, right now we're kind of sitting in a dark room, which, um, you know, is, is, you know, familiar for, for your podcast. But I think part of the, the vision for this over time is, is, you know, not just having this be like a video call. I mean, that's fine. It's. It's cool, or it feels like it's immersive, but, you know, you can, you can do a video call on your phone. The thing that you can do in the metaverse that is different from what you can do on a phone is like, doing stuff where you're physically there together and, and participating in things together. And we could play games like this. We could have meetings like this in the future. Once you mix, once you get mixed reality and augmented reality, we could have codec avatars like this and go into a meeting and have some people physically there and have some people show up in this photorealistic form superimposed on the physical environment. I think that stuff like that is going to be super powerful. So we got to still build out all those kind of applications and the use cases around it, but I don't know, I think it's going to be a pretty wild next few years around this. I mean, I just. I'm actually almost at a loss of words. This is just so incredible. This is truly incredible. I hope that people like watching this can get a glimpse of, like, how incredible it is. It really feels like we're in the same room. Like there is that. I guess there's an uncanny valley that seems to have been crossed here. Like it looks like you. Yeah, I mean, I think there's still a bunch of tuning that I think we'll want to do where different people emote to different extents. Right? So I think one of the big questions is, you know, like, when you smile, how wide is your smile and how wide do you want your smile to be? And I think getting that to be tuned on a per person basis is going to be one of the things that we're going to need to figure out. You know, it's like, to what extent do you want to give people control over that? You know, some people might try to, you know, might. Might prefer a version of themselves that's more emotive in their avatar than their actual faces. You know, so, for example, you know, I always get a lot of critique and shit for, for, for having like a relatively stiff expression. But, you know, I mean, I might, I might feel pretty happy, but just make a pretty small smile. So I mean, maybe, you know, for me, I would. It's actually, you know, it's like I'd want to have my avatar really be able to better express, like, how I'm feeling than. Than what, than how I can do physically. So I think that there's a question about how you want to tune that. But, but overall, yeah, I mean, we want to start from the baseline of capturing how people actually emote and express themselves. And I mean, I think the, the initial version of this is. Has been pretty impressive. And like you said, I do think we're. We're kind of beyond the. The uncanny valley here where it does feel like you. It doesn't feel. It doesn't feel weird or anything like that. I mean, that's going to be the meme that the two most monotone people are in a metaverse together. But I think that actually makes it more difficult. The amazing thing here is that the subtleties of the expression of the eyes. People say I'm monotone and emotionless, but I'm not. It's just maybe my expression of emotion is more subtle, usually like with the eyes. And that's one of the things I've noticed is just how expressive the subtle movement of the corners of the eyes are in terms of displaying happiness or boredom or all that kind of stuff. I am curious to see just because I've never done one of these before. I've never done a podcast as one of these codec avatars, and I'm curious to see what people think of it because one of the issues that we've had in some of the VR and mixed reality work is it tends to feel a lot more profound when you're in it than the 2D videos capturing the experience. So I think that this one, because it's photo.",
