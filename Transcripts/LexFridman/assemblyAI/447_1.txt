  "transcription": "All right, this is awesome. We have Michael Aman, Suale, Arvid here from the Cursor team. First up, big ridiculous question. What's the point of a code editor? So the code editor is largely the place where you build software. And today, or for a long time, that's meant the place where you text edit a formal programming language. And for people who aren't programmers, the way to think of a code editor is like a really souped up word processor for programmers, where the reason it's souped up is code has a lot of structure. And so the word processor, the code editor, can actually do a lot for you that word processors sort of in the writing space haven't been able to do for people editing text there. And so that's everything from giving you visual differentiation of the actual tokens in the code so you can scan it quickly, to letting you navigate around the code base. Sort of like you're navigating around the Internet with hyperlinks. You're going to sort of definitions of things you're using to error checking."
