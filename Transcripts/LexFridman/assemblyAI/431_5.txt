  "transcription": "What to you is the probability that super intelligent AI will destroy all human civilization? What's the time frame? Let's say 100 years, in the next hundred years. So the problem of controlling AGI or superintelligence, in my opinion, is like a problem of creating a perpetual safety machine by analogy with perpetual motion machine. It's impossible. Yeah, we may succeed and do a good job with GPT 5, 6, 7, but they just keep improving, learning, eventually self modifying, interacting with the environment, interacting with malevolent actors. The difference between cybersecurity, narrow AI safety and safety for general AI for superintelligence is that we don't get a second chance with cybersecurity. Somebody hacks your account, what's the big deal? You get a new password, new credit card, you move on Here. If we're talking about existential risks, you only get one chance. So you're really asking me what are the chances that will create the most complex software ever on a first try with zero bugs? And it will continue have zero bugs for 100 years or more. So there is an incremental improvement of systems leading up to AGI, to you, it doesn't matter if we can keep those safe. There's going to be one level of system at which you cannot possibly control it. I don't think we so far have made any system safe at the level of capability they display. They already have made mistakes. We had accidents, they've been jailbroken. I don't think there is a single large language model today which no one was successful at making do something developers didn't intend it to do. But there's a difference between getting it to do something unintended, getting it to do something that's painful, costly, destructive, and something that's destructive to the level of hurting billions of people, or hundreds of millions of people, billions of people, or the entirety of human civilization. That's a big leap. Exactly. But the systems we have today have capability of causing X amount of damage. So when they fail, that's all we get. If we develop systems capable of impacting all of humanity, all of universe, the damage is proportionate. What do you are the possible ways that such kind of mass murder of humans can happen? It's always a wonderful question. So one of the chapters in my new book is about unpredictability. I argue that we cannot predict what a smarter system will do. So you're really not asking me how superintelligence will kill everyone, you're asking me how I would do it. And I think it's not that interesting. I can tell you about a standard nanotech synthetic bionuclear superintelligence will come up with something completely new, completely super. We may not even recognize that as a possible path to achieve that goal. So there is like an unlimited level of creativity in terms of how humans could be killed. But, you know, we could still investigate possible ways of doing it. Not how to do it, but the. At the end, what is the methodology that does it? You know, shutting off the power and then humans start killing each other. Maybe because the resources are really constrained that there. Then there's the actual use of weapons, like nuclear weapons or developing artificial pathogens, viruses, that kind of stuff. We could still kind of think through that and defend against it. Right? There's a ceiling to the creativity of mass murder of humans here, right? The options are limited. They are limited by how imaginative we are. If you are that much smarter, that much more creative, you are capable of thinking across multiple domains, do novel research in physics and biology, you may not be limited by those tools. If squirrels were planning to kill humans, they would have a set of possible ways of doing it, but they would never consider things we can come up with. So are you thinking about mass murder and destruction of human civilization? Are you thinking of. With squirrels? You put them in a zoo and they don't really know they're in a zoo. If we just look at the entire set of undesirable trajectories, majority of them are not going to be death. Most of them are going to be just like things like Brave New World, where the squirrels are fed dopamine and they're all doing some kind of fun activity. And the sort of the fire, the soul of humanity is lost because of the drug that's fed to it, or literally not.",
