  "transcription": "HA HA HA HA HAHA HA HA A  THIS IS THE GREAT LIGHTING CHANGE WE  YEYOU UT THE LIGHT ANYWHERE AND IT DOESN'T FEEL AWKWARD TO BE REALLY CLOSE TO YOU NO IT DOES I ACTUALLY MOVED YOU AND MOVED YOU BACK A FEW FEET BEFORE YOU GOT IN WHILL HED SET YOU WERE LIKE RIGHT HERE I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE CAN SEE THIS BUT THIS IS THE REALISM HERE IS JUST INCREDIBLE WHERE AM I WHERE ARE YOU MARK WHEREWER WHERE ARE WE YOU'RE IN AUSTIN RIGHT NO I MEAN THIS PLACE WHERE IT WERE SHROUDED BY DARKNESS WITH ULTRA REALISTIC FACE AND JUST FEELS LIKE ONE IN THE SAME ROOM THIS IS REALLY THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING I'VE EVER SEEN AND SORRY TO BE IN YOUR PERSONAL SPACE I MEAN WE HAVE DONE JUJUSTIT BEFORE NOW IAS I WAS COMMENTING TO THE TEAM BEFORE THAT EVEN I FEEL LIKE WE'VE CHOKED EACH OTHER FROM FURTHER DISTANCES AND IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE I MEAN THIS IS JUST REALLY INCREDIBLE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT WITH WORDS IT REALLY FEELS LIKE IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN THE SAME ROOM YE FEELS LIKE THE FUTURE THIS  TRULY TRULY INCREDIBLE I JUST WANTED TO TAKE IT IN I'M STILL GETTING USED TO IT'S LIKE IT'S YOU IT'S REALLY YOU BUT YOU'RE NOT HERE WITH ME RIHT YOU'RE THERE WEARING A HEAD SET AND I'M WEARING A HEAD SET IS IT'S REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE SO WAT A CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT IT TAKES CURRENTLY FOR US TO APPEAR SO PHOTO REALISTIC TO EACH OTHER YES SO I MEAN FOR FOR BACKGROUND WE BOTH DID THESE SCANS FOR A THIS RESEARCH PROJECT THAT THAT WE HAVE AT METTA CALLED KODAK AVATARS AND THE IDEA IS THAT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY INSTEAD OF OUR AVATARS BEING CARTOONY AMAN INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TRANS ING A VIDEO WHAT IT DOES IS WE'VESCANNED OURSELVES AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS AND WE'VE BUILT A COMPUTER MODEL OF SORT OF EACH OF OUR FACES AND BODIES ANDA THE DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS THAT WE MAKE AND COLLAPSED THAT INTO A KODAK THAT THEN WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD SET ON YOUR HEAD IT CANI SEIZE YOUR FACE IT SEIS YOUR EXPRESSION AND IT CAN BASICLY SEND A AN ED VERSION OF WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE OVER THE WIRE SO SO IN ADDITION TO BEING PHOTO REALISTIC IT'S ALSO ACTUALLY MUCH MORE BANDWITH EFFICIENT THAN TRANSMITTING A FULL VIDIO OR ESPECIALLY A THREE D MERSI VIDIO OF A WHOLE SCENE LIKE THIS AD IT CAPTURES EVERYTHING LIKE THE FLAWS LIKE TO ME THE SUBTLETIES OF THE HUMAN FACE LIKE EVEN THE FLAWS THAT'S LIKE THAT'S ALL AMAZING IT MAKES YOU A IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE MERSIVE IT MAKES YOU REALIZE IT LIKE FECTION ISN'T THE THING THAT LEADS TO IMMERSION IT'S LIKE THE LITTLE SUBTLE FLAWS LIKE FRECKLES AND LIKE VARIATIONS IN COLOR AND JUST E WRINKLES ALL STICES AROSES YE A SYMMETRY AND JUST DIFFERENT LIKE THE CORNERS OF THE EYES LIKE WHAT YOUR EYES DO WHEN YOU SMILE ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF YE EYES ARE A HUGE PART OF IT THEAMINTERS ALL THE STUDIES THAT MOST OF COMMUNICATION EVEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING IS NOT ACTUALLY THE WORDS THAT THEYARE SAYING R ITS IS KIND OF TH EXPRESSION AND ALL THAT SO AND WE TRY TO CAPTURE THAT WITH A KIND OF CLASSICAL A EXPRESSIVE ABOTAR SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THAT'S THE KIND OF MORE CARTOON DESIGNED ONE YOU CAN YOU CAN KIND OF PUT THOSE KIND OF EXPRESSIONS ON THOSE FACES AS WELL BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A CERTAIN REALISM THAT COMES WITH DELIVERING KIND OF THIS PHOTO REALISTIC EXPERIENCE THAT I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY MAGICAL  THIS GETS TO KIND OF THE CORE OF WHAT THE VISION AROUND VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY IS LIKE DELIVERING A SENSE OF PRESENCE AS IF YOU'RE THERE TOGETHER OR WHERE YOU ACTUALLY ARE IN THE WORLD AND I MEAN THIS THIS I EXPERIENCE I THINK IT'S A GOOD EMBODIMENT OF THAT WHERE IT'S LIKE HAVING WERE IN TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STATES HALF WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT'S JUST LIKE OW IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE JUST SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME IT'S PRETTY WILD I CAN'T IT'S I ALMOST GETTING EMOTIONAL AS TI  FEELS LIKE A TOTALLY IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY NEW EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR ME TO HAVE THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION WITH LOVED ONES IT WOULD JUST CHANGE EVERYTHING IT MAY BE JUST TO ELABORATE SO THAT I WENT TO PITTSBURG AND WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE SCANNING PROCEDURE WHICH HAS SO MUCH INCREDIBLE  TECHNOLOGY SO SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE GOING ON BUT IT IS A LENGTHY PROCESS SO WHAT'S YOUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS IN TERMS OF MAKING THIS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW IT STARTS OFF WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DOING THESE AH VERY DETAILED SCANS RIGHT RICHESI THAT'S THE VERSION THAT YOU DID AND THAT I DID AND YOU KNOW BEFORE THERE ARE A LOTOF PEOPLE WHO WE'VE DONE THIS KIND OF A SCAN FOR WE PROBABLY NEED TO KIND OF OVER COLLECT EXPRESSIONS  WHEN WE'RE DOING THE SCANNING BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW MUCH WE CAN REDUCE THAT DOWN TO A REALLY STREAM LINE PROCESS IM AN EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE THE THE SCANS THAT HAVE AREADY BEEN DONE BUT IRE THE GOAL AND WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT'S WORKING ON THIS ALREADY IS JUST TO DO A VERY QUICK SCAN WITH YOUR SELL PHONE WHERE YOU JUST TAKE YOUR PHONE COUNT OF WAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AH SAY A FEW SENTENCES MAKE A BUNCH OF EXPRESSIONS AH BUT OVER ALL HAVE THE WHOLE PROCESS JUST BE TWO TO THREE MINUTES AND THEN PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT'S OF THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO ITHAT THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES THAT REMAINS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE SCANS IF YOU YODO'T HAVE HOURS TO SIT FOR ONE AND WEN TODAYS TECHNOLOGY ND YOU'RE USING A META HEAD SET THAT EXISTS IT'S A PRODUCT THAT'S KIND OF FOR SALE NOW YOU CAN DRIVE T WITH THAT AH BUT THE PRODUCTION OF OF A THESE SCANS IN A VERY EFFICIENT WAY IS ONE OF THE LAST PIECES THAT WE STILL NEED TO REALLY NAIL AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE'S LL THE EXPERIENCES AROUND IT IN RIGHT NOW WER WE'RE KIND OF SITTING IN A DARK ROOM WHICH AH YO NOIS IS  FAMILIAR FOR FOR PODCAST BUT I THINK PART OF THE DEVISION FOR THIS OVERTIME IS A IS YOU KNOW NOT JUST HAVING THIS BEE LIKE A VIDEO CALL I MEAN THAT'S FINEI IT'S COOL OR IT FEELS LIKE SUBMERSIVE BUT AH YOU CAN DO A VIDIO CALL ON YOUR PHONE THE THING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE METAVERSE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU CAN DO ON A PHONE IS LIKE DOING STUFF WHERE YOU'RE PHYSICALLY THERE TOGETHER AND PARTICIPATING IN THINGS TOGETHER AND WE COULD PLAY GAMES LIKE THIS AH WE COULD HAVE MEETINGS AH LIKE THISN IN THE FUTURE ONCE YOU MIX AH ONCE WE GET MIXED REALITY AND AUGMENTED REALITY WE COULD HAVE KODAK AVATARS LIKE THIS AND GO INTO A MEETING AND HAVE SOME PEOPLE PHYSICALLY THERE AND HAVE SOME PEOPLE SHOW UP IN THIS PHOTO REALISTIC FORM A SUPERIMPOSED ON ON THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT I THINKTHA STUFF LIKE THAT IS GOING TO BE SUPER POWERFUL SO WE OGHT TO STILL BUILD OUT ALL THOSE KIND OF APPLICATIONS AND THE USE CASES AROUND IT BUT I DON'T KNO ITHINK ITS GONG OBE PRETTY WILD OU NEXT FEW YEARS ARE ON THIS IAJET I'D AMAXO ALMOST AT A LOSS OF WORDS THIS IS JUST SO INCREDIBLE THIS IS TRULY INCREDIBLE I HOPE THAT PEOPLE LIKE WATCHING THIS CAN GET A GLIMPSE OF LIKE HOW INCREDIBLE IT IS IT REALLY FEELS LIKE GONG TO SAY LIKE THERE IS THAT AH I GUESS THERE'S AN UNCANNY VALLEY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CROSSED HERE LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU Y I MEAN IYO THERE'S STILL A BUNCH OF TUNING THAT I THINK WE'LL WANT TO DO WHERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE AMOTE TO DIFFERENT EXTENTS RIGHT SO I THINK ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS YOU KNOW IK WHEN YOU SMILE HOW WIDE IS YOUR SMILE AND HOW WIDE DO YOU WANT YOUR SMILE TO BE AH AND I THINK GETTING THAT TO BE TUNED ON A PER PERSON BASIS IS AH IT'S GOING TO BE ONE THE THINGS THAT WET WE'RE ING O NEED TO FIGURE OUT AH YOU DOTY TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THAT AH SOME PEOPLE MIGHT TRY TO MIGHT MIGHT PREFER A VERSION OF THEMSELVES THAT'S MORE MOTIVE IN THEIR AVATAR THAN THEIR ACTUAL FACES YNO SIR FOR EXAMPLE YOUNOW I ALWAYS GET A LOT OF A CRITIQUE AND ANCHIT FOR A FOR FOR HAVING A RELATIVELY STIFF EXPRESSION BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN I MIGHT I MIGHT FEEL PRETTY HAPPY BUT JUST MAKE A PRETTY SMALL SMILE SOME AN MAYBE ENOUGH FOR ME IT'S ACTUALLY OU KNOW IT IC I'D WANT TO HAVE MY AVOTAR REALLY BE ABLE TO BETTER EXPRESS A LIKE HOW I'M FEELING THEN THAN WHAT THEN HOW I CAN DO PHYSICALLY SO I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO TUNE THAT BUTA BUT OVER ALL YET I MEAN WE WANT TO START FROM THE BASE LINE OF CAPTURING HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY AMOTE AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND D I THINK THE INITIAL VERSION OF THIS IS HAS BEEN PRETTY IMPRESSIVE AND LIKE YOU SAID AH I DO THINK WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF BEYOND HE THE UNCANNY VALLEY HERE WHERE IT  IT DOES FEEL LIKE YOU IT DOESN'T FEEL IT DOESN'T FEEL WEIRD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I MEAN THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MEN THAT THE TWO MOST MONOTONE PEOPLE ARE IN A MINIVERSE TOGETHER BUT I THINK THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT I THE THE AMAZING THING HERE IS THAT THE SUBTLETIES OF THE EXPRESSION OF THE EYES PEOPLE SAY I'M MONOTONE AND EMOTIONLESS BUT I'M NOT IT'S JUSTT MAY BE MY EXPRESSION OF EMOTION IS MORE SUBTLE USUALLY LIKE WIT THE EYES AND UNLESS ONE O THINGS I'VE NOTICED I'S JUST HOW EXPRESSV THE SUBTLE MOVEMENT OF THE CORNERS OF THE EYES A ARE IN TERMS OF DISPLAYING HAPPINESS OR BOREDOM OR ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF I AM CURIOUS TO SEE JUST AS I'VE NEVER DONE ONE OF THESE BEFORE I'VE NEVER DONE A PODCAST AS IS ONE OF THESE KODAK AVATARS A CURIOY WHAT WHAT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD IN SOME OF THE V R AND ADMIXED REALITY WORK IS IT TENDS TO FEEL A LOT MORE PROFOUND WHEN YOU'RE IN IT THAN THE TWO D VIDIOS CAPTURING THE EXPERIENCE SO I THAT THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S POTO",
