  "transcription": "YOU'VE HAD SOME STRONG STATEMENTS TECHNICAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RECENTLY THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER ACTUALLY BUT RECENTLY AS WELL YOU'VE SAID THAT AUTO AGRESSIVE ELELAMS ARE A NOT THE WAY Y E'RE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD SUPERHUMAN INTELLIGENCE THESE ARE THE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS LIKE G P T FOUR LIKE LAMA TWO AND THREE SOON AND SO ON HOW DO THEY WORK AND WHY ARE THEY NOT GOING TO TAKE US ALL AWAY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS A NUMBER OF CHARACTERISTICS OF INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR FOR EXAMPLE THE CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL WORLD THE ABILITY TO REMEMBER AND RETRIEVE THINGS A PERSISTENT MEMORY THE ABILITY TO REASON AND THE ABILITY TO PLAN THOSE ARE FOUR ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF INTELLIGENCE ER SYSTEMS OR ANTITIES HUMANS ANIMALS ELENEMS CAN DO NONE OF THOSE OR THEY CAN ONLY DO THEM IN A VERY PRIMITIVE WAY AND AH THEY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICAL WORLD THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE PERSISTENT MEMORY THEY CAN'T REALLY REASON AND THEY CERTAINLY CAN PLAN AND SO YOU KNOW IF IF IF YOU EXPECT THE SYSTEM TO BECOME INTELLIGENT JUST YOU KNOW WITHOUT HAVING THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING THOSE THINGS YOUARE MAKING A MISTAKE THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT OTOREGATIVEELELEMS ARE NOT USEFUL THEY ARE CERTAINLY USEFUL A THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTING THAT WE CAN BUILD A WHOLE ECO SYSTEM OF APPLICATIONS AROUND THEM OF COURSE WE CAN BUT AS A PASS TOWARDS HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE THEY ARE MISSING ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER TIDBIT FACT THAT I THINK IS VERY INTERESTING THOSE EELEMS ARE TRAINED ONENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF TEX BASICALLY THE ENTIRETY OF ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TEXTS ON THE INTERNET RIGT THAT'S TYPICALLY ON THE ORDER OF TEN TO THE THIRTEEN TOKENS EACH TOKEN IS TYPICALLY TWO BITES SO THAT'S TWO TEN TO THE THIRTEEN BITES AS TRAINING DATA IT WOULD TAKE YOU OR ME A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS TO JUST READ THROUGH THIS AT EIGHT HOURS A DAY AH SO IT SEEMS LIKE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE RIGHT THAT THOSE SYSTEMS CAN ACCUMULATE AH BUT THEN YOU REALIZE THI'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH DATA IF YOU TALK TO DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AND THEY TELL YOU A FOUR YEAR OLD HAS BEEN AWAKE FOR SIXTEEN THOUSAND HOURS IN YEARS OR OUR LIFE AH AND THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT HAS ER REACHED THE VISUAL CORTEX OF THAT CHILD IN FOUR YEARS AH IS ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN BITES AND YOU CAN COMPUTE THIS BY ESTIMATING THAT THE OPTICAL NERVE CARRY ABOUT TWENTY M MAGA BITES PER SECOND ROUGHLY AND SO TEN TO THE FIFTEEN BITES FOR FOUR YEAR OLD VERSES TWO TIMES TEN TO THIRTEEN BITES FOR A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS WORTH OF READING WHAT I TELL YOU IS THAT A THROUGH SENSORY INPUT WE SEE A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAN WE DO THROUGH LANGUAGE AND THAT DESPITE OUR INTUITION MOST OF WHAT WE LEARN AND MOST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS THROUGH OBSERVATION AND INTERACTION WITH THE REAL WORLD NOT THROUGH LANGUAGE EVERYTHING THAT WE LEARN IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE AND AH CERTAINLY EVERYTHING THAT ANIMALS LEARN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LANGUAGE SO BE GOOD TO A MAYBE PUSH AGAINST SOME OF THE INTUITION BEHIND WHAT YE ARE SAYING SO IT IS TRUE THERE AR SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE DATA COMING INTO THE HUMAN MIND HOW MUCH FASTER AND THE HUMAN MIND IS ABLE TO LEARN VERY QUICKLY FROM THAT FILTER THE DATA VERY QUICKLY KNOW SOMEBODY MIGHT ARGUE YOUR COMPARISON BETWEEN SENSORY DATA VERSUS LANGUAGE THAT LANGUAGE IS ALREADY VERY COMPRESSED IT ALREADY CONTAINS A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAN THE BITES IT TAKES TO STORE THEM IF YOU COMPARE IT TO VISUAL DATA SO THERE'S A LOT OF WISDOM IN LANGUAGE ORS WORDS AND THE WAY WE STITCH THEM TOGETHER IT ALREADY CONTAINS A LOT OF INFORMATION SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT LANGUAGE ALONE ALREADY HAS ENOUGH WIS M AND KNOWLEDGE IN THERE TO BE ABLE TO FROM THAT LANGUAGE CONSTRUCT A WORLD MODEL AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD THAT YOUARE SAYING A LAMS LACK SO IT'S A BIG DEBATE AMONG E PHILOSOPHERS AND ALSO CATIVE SCIENTISTS AK WHETHER INTELLIGENCE NEEDS TO BE GROUNDED IN REALITY I AM CLEARLY IN THE CAMP THAT YES INTELLIGENCE CANNOT APPEAR WITHOUT SOME GROUNDING IN SOME REALITY DOESN'T NEED TO BE PHYSICAL REALITY T COULD BE SIMULATED BUT AH BUT THE ENVIRONMENT IS JUST MUCH RICHER THAN WHAT YOU CAN EXPRESS IN LANGUAGE LANGUAGE IS A VERY APPROXIMATE REPRESENTATION OF OUR PERCEPTS AND OR MENTAL MODELS RIGHT IMEAN IT IS A LOT OF TASKS THAT WE ACCOMPLISH WHERE WE MANIPULATE A A MENTAL MODEL OF O THE SITUATION AT HAND AND THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LANGUAGE EVERYTHING THAT'S PHYSICAL MECHANICAL WHATEVER WHEN WE BUILD SOMETHING WHEN ACCOMPLISH E TASK A MODER TASK OF YOU KNOW GRABBING SOMETHING ET CETERA WE PLAN OR ACTION SEQUENCES AND WE DO THIS BY ESSENTIALLY IMAGINING THE RESULT OF THE OUTCOME OF A SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS WE MIGHT IMAGINE AND THAT REQUIRES MENTAL MORALS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH LANGUAGE AND THAT I WOULD ARGUE MOST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS DERIVED FROM THAT INTERACTION WITH THEPHYSICAL WORLD SO LOIPLOW MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THINGS O COMPUO VISION ARE REALLY ON THAT CAMP THAT A I NEEDS TO BE EMBODIED ESSENTIALLY AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE COMING FROM THE AN ALPESIDE OR MAYBE YOU KNOW SOME SOME OTHER ER MOTIVATION DON'T NECESARILY AGREE WITH THAT  AND PHILOSOPHERS AE SPLIT AS WELL  AND THE ER THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD IS HARD TO AR IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE INOWS HOW TO REPRESENT  ALL THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WE TAKE COMPLETELY FOR GRANTED IN THE REAL WORLD THAT WE DON'T EVEN IMAGINE WE EQUIRE INTELLIGENCE WHERE THIS IS THE OLD MAREVE PARADOX FROM THE PARNEOF ROBATICS HANCE MARVE WE SAID YOU KNOW HOW IS IT THAT WITH COMPUTERS IT SEEMS TO BE EASY TO DO HIGH LEVEL COMPLEX TASKS LIKE PLAYING CHESS AND SOLVING INTERGUALS AND DOING THINGS LIKE THAT WHEREAS THE THING WE TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT WE DO EVERY DAY A I CANNOT KNOW LEARNING TO DRIVE A CAR OR WE KNOW GRABBING AN OBJECT WE CAN'T DO AS COMPUTERS A AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE AT ALEM THEY CAN PASS PASS THE BAR EXAM SO THEY MUST BE SMART BUT THEN THEY CAN'T LEARN TO DRIVE IN TWENTY HOURS LIKE ANY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD THEY CAN'T LEARN TO CLEAR UP THE DINNER TABLE AND FILL F THE DISHWASHER LIKE ANY TEN YEAR OLD CAN LEARN IN ONE SHOT A WHY SAT LIK NO WHAT WHAT WE MISSING WHAT TYPE OF LEARNING OR OR REASONING ARCHITECTURE OR WHATEVER ARE WE MISSING THAT A MIS YO PREVENT US FROM FROM YOU KNOW HAVING LEVEL FIVE SUBDRIVINE CARS AND DOMESTIC QUOBOTS CAN A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL CONSTRUCT A WORLD MODEL THAT DOES KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND DOES KNOW HOW TO FILL A DISH WASHUP BUT JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH VISUAL DATA AT THIS TIME SO IT CAN OPE A SPACE OF CONCEPTS SO YES THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON SO THE ANSWER THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO AND THE MORE COMPLEX ANSWER IS YOU CAN USE ALL KINDS OF TRICKS TO GET A A NELALEM TO VYSICALLY DIGEST ER VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF REPRESENTATIONS OF IMAGES ORVIDIO OR AUDIO FOR THAT MATTER AH AND A CLASSICAL WAY OF DOING THIS IS YOU TRAIN A VISION SYSTEM IN SOME WAY AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO TRAIN VISION SYSTEMS EITHER SUPERVISE AND BE SUPERVISED SELF SUPERVISE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WILL TURN ANY IMAGE INTO HIGH LEVEL REPRESENTATION PYSICALLY A LIST OF TOKENS THAT ARE REALLY SIMILAR TO THE KINDOF TOKENS THAT A TYPICAL ALEM TAKES A AN INPUT AND THEN YOU JUST FEED THAT TO THE EALEM IN ADDITION TO THE TEXT AND YOU JUST EXPECTED ATEM TO KIND OF ER YOUR DRING TRAINING TO KIND OF BE ABLE TO  USE THOSE REPRESENTATIONS TO HELP E MAKE DECISIONS I MEAN THET'S BEEN WORKING ALONG THOSE LINES FOR FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND NOW YOU SEE THOSE SYSTEMS RIGHT I MEAN THERE ARE ELEMENTS THAT CAN THT HAVE SOME VISION EXTENSION BUT IT BASICALLY HACKS IN THE SENSE THAT ER THOSE THINGS ARE NOT LIKE TRAIN AND TO ENT TO HANDL TO REA UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THERE NOT TRAINE WITH VIDIO FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T READY UNDERSTAND INTUITIVE PHYSICS AT LEAST NOT AT THE MOMENTSO YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL TO YOU ABOUT INTUITIVE PHYSICS ABOUT SORT OF COMMON SENSE REASONING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL SPACE ABOUT PHYSICAL REALITY THAT THAT TO YOU IS THE GIANT LEAP THAT AMSA JUST NOT ABLE TO DO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH THE TYPE OF EATEMS THAT WE ARE  WORKING WITH TO DAY AND THERE IS A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS BUT THE MAIN REASON IS THE WAY A EMS ARE TRAINED IS THATYO TAKE",
