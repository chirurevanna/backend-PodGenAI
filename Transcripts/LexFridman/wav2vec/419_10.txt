  "transcription": "TAKE ME THROUGH THE OPENE BOR SAGA THAT STARTED ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH MAYBE FRIDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH FOR YOU THAT WAS DEFENITLY THE MOST PAINFUL PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE AND CHAOTIC AND SHAMEFUL AND UPSETTING AND A BUNCH OF OTHER NEGATIVE THINGS A THERE WERE GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT TOO AND I WISH I WISH IT HADNOT BEEN IN SUCH AN ADRENNEL AND RUSH THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO STOP AND APPRECIATE THEM AT THE TIME BUT AM I CAME ACROSS THIS OLD TWEED OF MINEO THIS TWEED OF MINE FROM THAT TIME PERIOD WHICH WAS LIKE IT WAS LIKE OUO KIND OF GOING TO YOUR OWN EULOGY AN WATCHING PEOPLE SAY ALL THESE GREAT THINGS ABOUT YOU AND AH JUST LIKE UNBELIEVABLE SUPPORT FROM PEOPLEI LOVE AND CARE ABOUT AH THAT WAS REALLY NICE AM THAT WHOLE WEEK END I KIND OF LIKE FELT WITH ONE BIG EXCEPTION I FELT LIKE A GREAT DEAL OF LOVE A VERY LITTLE HATE A EVEN THOUGH IT FELT LIKE I JUST I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND THIS FEELS REALLY BAD AND THER WRE DEFENLY TIMES I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS TO EVER HAPPEN FOR AI SAFETY WELL I ALSO THINK I'M HAPPY THAT IT HAPPENED RELATIVELY EARLY I THOUGHT AT SOME POINT BETWEEN WHEN OPENING I STARTED AND WHEN WE CREATED A G I THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING CRAZY AND EXPLOSIVE THAT HAPPENED BUT THERE MAY BE MORE CRAZY AND EXPLOSIVE THINGS STILL TO HAPPEN A IT STILL I THINK HELPED US BUILD UP SOME RESILIENCE AND BE READY FOR MORE CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE BUT THE THING YOU HAD THAT YOU WOULD EXPERIENCE IS SOME KIND OF POWER STRUGGLE THE ROAD TO AGIO SHOULD BE A GIANT POWER STRUGGLE LIKE THE WORLD SHOULD LIKEI WELL NOT SHOULD I EXPECT THAT TO BE THE CASE AND SO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT LIKE YOU SAID ITERATE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE FIGURING OUT HOW TO HAVE A BOARD STRUCTURE HOW TO HAVE ORGANIZATION HOW TO HAVE AH THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH HOW TO COMMUNICATE ALL THAT IN ORDER TO E D ESCOLATE THE POWER STRUGGLE AS MUCH AS POSS PACIFY IT BUT AT THIS POINT IT FEELS YOU KNOW LIKE SOMETHING THAT WAS IN THE PAST THAT WAS REALLY UNPLEASANT AND REALLY DIFFICULT AND PAINFUL BUT WE'RE BACK TO WORK AND THINGS ARE SO BUSY AND SO INTENSE THAT I DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT IT THERE WAS A TIME AFTER AH HIT WAS LIKE THIS FUGUE STATE AM FOR KIND OF LIKE THE MONTH AFTER MAYBE FORTY FIVE DAYS AFTER THAT WAS I WAS JUST SORT OF LIKE DRIFTING THROUGH THE DAYS I WAS SO OUT OF IT AM I WAS FEELING SO DOWN JUST HAD A PERSONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EE REALLY PAINFUL EM AND HARD TILL I HAVE TO KEEP RUNNING OPEN THE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT I JUST WANTED TO I CRAWL INTO A CAVE AND KIND OF RECOVER FOR A WHILE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW LIKE WE'RE JUST BACK TO WORKING ON THE MISSION WHAT'S STILL USEFUL TO GO BACK THERE AND REFLECT ON BOARD STRUCTURES ON POWER DYNAMICS ON HOW COMPANIES ARE RUN THE TENSION BETWEEN RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MONEY AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF SO THATT YOU WHO HAVE A VERY HIGH POTENTIAL OF BUILDING A G I WOULD DO SO IN A SLIGHTLY MORE ORGANIZED LESS DRAMATIC WAY IN THE FUTURE SO THERE'S VALUE THERE TO GO BOTH THE PERSONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF YOU AS A LEADER AND ALSO JUST  THE BOARD STRUCTURE AND ALL THIS KIND OF MESSY STUFF DEFINITELY LEARNED A LOT ABOUT AM STRUCTURE AND INCENTIVES AND AM WHAT WE NEED OUT OF ABOARD AM AND I THINK THAT IS IT IS VALUABLE THAT THIS HAPPENED NOW IN SOME SENSE IM I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY NOT LIKE THE LAST HIGH STRESS MOMENT OF OPEN A BUT IT WAS QUITE A HIGH STRESS MOMENT MY COMPANY VERY NEARLY GOT DESTROYED AND WE THINK A LOT ABOUT MANY OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE GOT TO GET RIGHT FOR AGI BUT THINKING ABOUT A HOW TO BUILD A RESILIENT ORG AND HOW TO BUILD A STRUCTURE THAT WILL STAND UP TO LIKE A LOT OF PRESSURE IN THE WORLD WHICH I EXPECT MORE AND MORE AS WE GET CLOSER I THINK THAT'S SUPERIMPORTANT DEHAVE A SENSE OF HOW DEEP RIGOROUS THE DELIBERATION PROCESS BY THE BOARD WAS LIKE CAN YOU SHINE SOME LIGHT ONJUST HUMAN DYNAMICS INVOLVED IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WAS IT JUST A FEW CONVERSATIONS AND ALL SUDDEN ESCALADES AND WHY DON'T WE FIRE SAM KIND OF THING I THINK I THINK THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE ARE WELL MEANING PEOPLE ON THE WHOLE A AND I BELIEVE THAT IN STRESSFUL SITUATIONS A WHERE PEOPLE FEEL TIME PRESSURE WHATEVER A PEOPLE UNDERSTANDINGLY MAKE SUB OPTIMAL DECISIONS AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR OPENI EY WILL BE R GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A BOARD AND A TEAM THAT ARE GOOD AT OPERATING UNDER UNDER PRESSURE DO YOU THINK THE BOARD HAD TOO MUCH POWER I THINK BOARDS ARE HAVE A LOT OF POWER M BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID SEE IS IN MOST CORPORATE STRUCTURES BOARDS ARE USUALLY ANSWERABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS SENTHERS SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE LIKE SUPERVODING SHARES OR WHATEVER  IN THIS CASE AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WITH OUR STRUCTURE THAT WE MAY BE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT MORE THAN WE DID IS THAT THE BOARD OF A NON PROPHET HAS UNLESS YOU PUT OTHER RULES IN PLACE LIKE QUITE QUITE A LOT OF POWER THEY DON'T REALLY ANSWER TO ANYONE BUT THEMSELVES AND THERE'S WAYS IN WHICH THAT'S GOOD BUT WHAT WE'D REALLY LIKE IS FOR THE BOARD OF OPENING AY TO LIKE ANSWER TO THE WORLD AS A WHOLE AS MUCH AS THAT'S A PRACTICAL THING SO THERE'S A NEW BOARD ANNOUNCED YE THERE'S A GUESS A NEW SMALLER BOARD ER FIRST AN NOW THERE'S A NEW FINAL BOARD NOT A FINAL BOARD YET WE'VE ADDED SOMEWAT THAT ITSA ROKE WHAT IS FIXED IN THE NEW ONE THAT WAS PERHAPS BROKEN IN THE PREVIOUS ONE THE OLD BOARD SORT OF GOT SMALLER OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT A YEAR IT WAS NINE AND THEN IT WENT ON TO SIX AND THEN WE COULDN'T AGREE ON WHO TO ADD AND THE BOARD ALSO A I THINK WE DIDN'T HAVEA LOT OF EXPERIENCED BOARD MEMBERS AND A LOT OFTHE NEW BOARD MEMBERS AT OPEN HAVE JUST HAV MORE EXPERIENCE AS BOARD MEMBERS A I THINK THAT'LL HELP IT'S BEEN CRITICISED SOME OF THE PEOPLE ADDED TO THE BOARD I HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE CRITICISING THE ADDITION OF LARRY SALBERS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WHAS THE PROCESS OF SELECTING THE BOARD LIKE WHAT'S INVOLVED IN THAT SO BRET AND LARRY WERE KIND OF DECIDED IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT OVER DISLIKE VERY TENSE WEEK END AND THAT WAS THAT MEN A WEEK END WAS LIKE A REAL ROLLER COSTERS LIKE A LOT OF A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS AM AND WE WERE TRYING TO AGREE ON NEW BOARD MEMBERS THAT BOTH SORT OF THE EXECUTIVE TEAM HERE AND THE OLD BOARD MEMBERS FELT WOULD BE REASONABLE A LARRY WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THEIR SUGGESTIONS THE OLD BOARD MEMBERS A BRETT I THINK I HAD EVEN PREVIOUS TO THAT WEEK END SUGGESTED BUT HE WAS YOU KNOW BUSY AND DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT AND THEN WE REALLY NEEDED HELP AND WOULD AH WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE TOO BUT THAT WAS I FELT LIKE IF I WAS GOING TO COME BACK A I NEEDED NEW BOARD MEMBERS AM I DIDN'T THINK I COULD WORK WITH THE OLD BOARD AGAIN IN THE SAME CONFIGURATION ALTHOUGH WE THEN DECIDED AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT ADAM WOULD STAY AM BUT WE WANTED TO GET TO A WE CONSIDERED VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS DECIDED WE WANTED TO GET TO A BOARD OF THREE AND A HAD TO FIND TWO NEW BOARD MEMBERS OVER THE COURSE OF SORT OF A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO THOSE WERE DECIDED HONESTLY WITHOUT A YOU KNOW THAT'S LIKE YOU KIND OF DO THAT ON THE BATTLE FIELD YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO DESIGN OS PROCESS THEN IM FOR NEW BOARD MEMBERS SINCE NEW BOARD MEMBERS WILL ADD GOING FORWARD IM WE HAVE SOME CRITERIA THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE BOARD TO HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERTSE THAT WE WANT THE BOARD TO HAVE I'M UNLIKE HIRING AN EXECUTIVE WHERE YOU NEED THEM TO DO ONE OR WOLL WELL THE BOARD NEEDS TO DO A WHOLE ROLE OF KIND OF GOVERNANCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS A WELL AND SO ONE THING THAT BRETT SAYS WHICH I REALLY LIKE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT T HIRE MEMBERS IN SLATES NOT AS INDIVIDUALS ONE AT A TIME AND A YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BRING NON PROFIT EXPERTSE EXPERTESE AT RUNING COMPANIES SORT OF GOOD LEGAL AND GOVERNANCE EXPERTSE AH THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO OPTIMIZE FOR SO TECHNICAL SAVY IMPORTANT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBERS NOT FOR EVERY BOARD MEMBER BUT FOR CERTAINLY SOME YOU NEED NOT THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE BOARD NEEDS TO DO SO LET ME THE THINK THING THAT PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT OPEN AIR I CERTAINLY DON'T DISLIKE ALL THE DETAILS OF RUNNING THE BUSINESS",
