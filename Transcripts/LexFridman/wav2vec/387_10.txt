  "transcription": "YOU MENTION SOMETHING IN A STREAM ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE OF TIME SO LET'S START WITH THE WILD QUESTION DO YOU THINK TIME IS AN ILLUSION YOU KNOW I SELL PHONE CALLS AH TO COMA FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SOME GUY CALLED ME AND A LIKE YOU NOS A THOUS AND DOLLARS YOU CAN TALK TO ME FOR FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HE'S LIKE A YE OK SO LIKE TIME DOESN'T EXIST AND I REALLY WANTED TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU I'M LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN TIME DOESN'T EXIST ORI LIKE I THINK TIME IS A USEFUL MODEL WHETHER IT EXISTS OR NOT RIGHT LIKE DOES QUANTUM PHYSICS EXIST HT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ABOUT WHETHER IT'S A USEFUL MODEL TO DESCRIBE REALITY IS TIME MAYBE COMPRESSIVE DO YOU THINK THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE REALITY OR IS EVERYTHING JUST USEFUL MODELS LIKE UNDERNEATH IT ALL IS IT AN ACTUAL THING THAT CONSTRUCTING MODELS FOR I DON'T KNOW I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD KNOW I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS I MEAN THIS KIND OF CONNECTS TO THE MODELS WITH CONSTRUCTIVE REALITY WITH MACHINE LEARNING RIGHT SURE LIKE IS IT JUST NICE TO HAVE USEFUL APPROXIMATIONS OF THE WORLD SUCH THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE REAL COLUMOGRAPH COMPLEXITY IS REAL THE COMPREANATE  MATH IS REAL YE S T SHIRT AND I THINK HARD THINGS ARE ACTUALLY HARD I DON'T THINK P EQUALS N P OH STRONG WORDS WELL I THINK THAT'S THE MAJORITY I DO THINK FACTORING IS IN P BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE PERSON THAT FALLS IN THE MAJORITY IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE SOI'S GOOD FOR THAT ONE I DO YE IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE YOU YOU'RE ONE OF THE SHEEP ALL RIGHT BUT TO YOU TIME'S A USEFUL MODEL SHARP WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT ON THE STREAM WITH TIME ARE YOU MADE OF TIME IF I REMEMBERED HALF S I SAID ON  STREAM SOME DAY SOME ONES GOING TO MAKE A MODEL OF ALL THAT AND THAT'S GOING TO COME BACK TO HAUNT ME SOME DAY SOON YER PROBABLY WOULD THAT BE EXCITING TO YOU OR SAD THAT THERE'S A GEORGE HOTTS MODEL I MEAN THE QUESTION IS WHEN THE GEORGE HOTS MODEL IS BETTER THAN GEORGE HOTTS LIKE I AM DECLINING AND THE MODEL IS GROWING WHAT IS THE MAGIC BY WHICH YOU MEASURE BETTER OR WORSE IN THAT IF YOU ARE COMPETING WITH YOURSELF MAYBE YOU CAN JUST PLAY A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE THE GEORGE HOTS ANSWER AND THE GEORGE HOTS MODEL ANSWER AND ASK WHICH PEOPLE PREFER PEOPLE CLOSE TO YOU OR STRANGERS EITHER ONE IT WILL HURT MORE WHEN IT'S PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME BUT BOTH WILL BE OVERTAKEN BY THE GORCOTS MODEL IT BE QUITE PAINFUL RIHT LOVED ONES FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD RATHER HAVE THE MODEL OVER FOR THANKSGIVING THAN YOU EH OR LIKE SIGNIFICANT OTHERS WOULD RATHER SEXED WITH THE WITH A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL VERSION VEW ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S FINE TUNED TO THEIR PREFERENCES YES WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IN A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT WE'RD JUST FIND TUNING OURSELVES BUT WE'RE INEFFICIENT WITH IT BECAUSE WE'RE SELFISH AND GREEDY AND SO ON OUR LANGUAGE MODELS CAN FIND TUNE MORE EFFICIENTLY MORE SELFLESSLY THERE'S A STARTRIC VOYAGE OR EPISODE WHERE YOU KNOW CATHERINE JANEWAY LOST IN THE DELTA QUADRANT MAKES HERSELF A LOVER ON THE HOLIDAC AND A THE LOVER FALLS ASLEEP ER ARM AND HE SNORES A LITTLE BIT AND YOU KNOW JANE WAY DIT'S THE PROGRAMM TO REMOVE THAT AND THEN OF COURSE THE REALIZATION IS WAIT THIS PERSON'S TERRIBLE IT IS ACTUALLY ALL THERE AH NEWANCES AND QUIRKS AND SLIGHT ANNOYANCES  THAT MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP WORTH WHILE BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO REALIZE THAT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE WELL I THINK A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL COULD INCORPORATE THE THE FLAWS AND THE QUIRKS AND ALL THAT KIND OF SOF JUST THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF QUIRKS AND FLOR FLAWS TO MAKE YOU CHARMING WITHOUT CROSSING THE LINE  AD THERE'S PROBABLY A GOOD LIKE APPROXIMATION OF THE LIKE THE PERCENT OF TIME THE LANGUAGE MODEL SHOULD BE A CRANKY OR A AN ASS WHOLE OR JEALOUS OR ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF AND OF COURSE IT CAN AND IT WILL BUT ALL THAT DIFFICULTY AT THAT POINT IS ARTIFICIAL THERE'S NO MORE REAL DIFFICULTY GET WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THE REAL AND ARTIFICIAL ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY IS DIFFICULTY THAT'S LIKE TED OR COULD BE TURNED OFF WITH A KNOB REAL DIFFICULTY IS LIKE YOU'RE IN THE WOODS AND YOUE GOT TO SURVIVE SO IF SOMETHING CANNOT BE TURNED OFF WITH A KNOB IT'S REAL YES I THINK SO OR I MEAN YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS BY SMASHING THE KNOB WITH A HAMMER I MEAN MAYBE YOU KIND OF CAN YOU KNOW INTO THE WILD WHEN YOU KNOW ALEXANDER SUPER TRAMP HE WANTS TO EXPLORE SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN EXPLORED BEFORE BUT IT'S THE NINETIES EVERYTHING'S BEEN EXPLORED SO HE'S LIKE NOT GOING TO BRING A MAP YES I MEAN NO YOU'RE NOT EXPLORING YOU SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A MAP T  F YOU DIED THERE WAS A BRIDGE A MILE FROM WHERE YOU WERE CAMPING HOW DOES THAT CONNECT TO THE METAPHOR OF THE KNOB BY NOT BRINGING THE MAP YOU DIDN'T BECOME AN EXPLORER YOU JUST SMASHED THE THING YES YES THE ART OF THE DIFFICULTY IS STILL ARTIFICIAL YE FAILED BEFORE YOU STARTED WHAT IF WE JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE KNOB THAT MAYBE IS EVEN SCARIER RIGHT LIKE WER EXIST IN A WORLD OF NATURE AND NATURE HAS BEEN FINE TUNED OVER BILLIONS OF YEARS OM TO I HAVE A HUMANS FILLED SOMETHING AND THEN THROW THE KNOB AWAY IN SOME GRAND ROMANTIC GESTURE IS HORRIFYING DO YOU THINK OF US HUMANS AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LIKE BORN AND DIE OR IS IT A WE JUST ALL PART OF ONE LIVING ORGANISM THAT IS EARTH THAT IS NATURE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LINE THERE I THINK IT'S ALL KIND OF JUST FUZZY I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I DON'T THINK I'M CONSCIOUS I DON'T THINK I'M ANYTHING I THINK I'M JUST A CONFUTED PROGRAMME SO IT'S ALL COMPUTATION  THING RUNNING IN YOUR HEAD IS JUST  AS O DISCOMPUTATION EVERYTHING RUNING IN THE UNIVERSE IS COMPUTATION I THINK I BELIEVE THE EXTENDED CHURCH TYRING THESIS YET BUTI THERE SEEMS TO BE AN EMBODIMENT TO YOUR PARTICULAR COMPUTATION LIKE THERE'S A CONSISTENCY WELL YOU BELIE MEN MODELS HAVE CONSISTENCY TOO YES MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN RLAHAFT WILL CONTINUALLY SAG AND ALL LIKE WELL HOW DO I MURDER ETHNIC MINORITIES OH WELL I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT HAL THERE'S A CONSISTENCY TO THAT BEHAVIOR A ARL CHAF LIKE WE ARECHAF EACH OTHER WE WE FIND WE A PROVIDE HUMAN FEED BACK AND THERE THA THEREBY FIND TOO IN THESE LITTLE POCKETS OF COMPUTATION BUT IT'S TILL UNCLEAR WHY THAT POCKET OF COMPUTITION STAYS WITH YOU LIKE FOR YEARS IT JUS KIND OF FAT LIKE YOU HAVE THIS CONSISTENT SET OF A PHYSICS BIOLOGY AH WHAT LIKE WHATEVER YOU CALL TE TE NURONS FIRING K LIKE THE ELECTRICO SINNALS AND MECHANICAL SIGNALS ALL THAT THAT SEEMS TO STAY THERE AND IT CONTAINS INFORMATION IT STORES INFORMATION AND THAT INFORMATION PERMEATES THROUGH TIME AND STAYS WITH YOU THERES LIKE MEMORY LIK STICKY OK TO BE FAIR ALIKE A LOT OF T MODELS WE'RE BUILDING TO DAY ARE VERY EVEN R L H F IS NOWHERE NEAR AS COMPLEX AS THE HUMAN LOSS FUNCTION REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH HUMAND FIT BACK AM YOU KNOW WHEN I TALKED ABOUT WILL G P T TWELVE B A G I ANSWERS NO OF COURSE NOT I MEAN CROSS ENTRABY LOSS IS NEVER GOING TO GET YOU THERE YOU NEED AH PROBABLY RL IN FANCY ENVIRONMENTS IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED LIKE A G I LIKE SO TO ASK LIKE THE QUESTION ABOUT LIKE WHY I DON'T KNOW LIKE IT'S JUST SOME QUORK OF EVOLUTIONR I DONT THINK THERE'S ANYTHING PARTICULARLY SPECIAL ABOUT WHERE I ENDED UP WHERE HUMANS ENDED UP SO K WE HAVE HUMAN LEVEL INTELLIGENCE WOULD YOU CALL THAT A G I WHATEVER WE HAVE G I LOOK ACTUALLY I DON'T REALLY EVEN LIKE THE WORD A G I  BUT GENERAL INTELLIGENCE IS DEFINED TO BE WHATEVER HUMANS HAVE SO WHY CAN G P T TWELVE NOT GET US TO A G I CAN WE JUST LIKE LINGER ON THAT IF YOUR LOWST FUNCTION IS CATEGORICAL CROSS YOUR LOST FUNCTION IS JUST TRY TO MAXIMIZE COMPRESSION I'VE A SOUND CLOUD Y RAP AND
