  "transcription": "take me through the open ai board saga that started on thursday november sixteenth maybe friday november seventeenth for you that was definitely the most painful professional experience of my life and chaotic and shameful and upsetting and a bunch of other negative things there were great things about it too and i wish i wish it had not been in such an adrenaline rush that i wasn't able to stop and appreciate them at the time but i came across this old tweet of mine or this tweet of mine from that time period which was like it was like you know kind of going to your own eulogy watching people say all these great things about you and just like unbelievable support from people i love and care about that was really nice that whole weekend i kind of like felt with one big exception i felt like a great deal of love and very little hate even though it felt like just i have no idea what's happening and what's going to happen here and this feels really bad and there were definitely times i thought it was gonna be like one of the worst things to ever happen for ai safety well i also think i'm happy that it happened relatively early i thought at some point between when openai started and when we created agi there was going to be something crazy and explosive that happened but there may be more crazy and explosive things still to happen it still i think helped us build up some resilience and be ready for more challenges in the future but the thing you had a sense that you would experience is some kind of power struggle the road to agi should be a giant power struggle like the world should i like well not should i expect that to be the case and so you have to go through that like you said iterate as often as possible in figuring out how to have a board structure how to have organization how to have the kind of people that you're working with how to communicate all that in order to de escalate the power struggle as much as possible yeah pacify it but at this point it feels you know like something that was in the past that was really unpleasant and really difficult and painful but we're back to work and things are so busy and so intense that i don't spend a lot of time thinking about it there was a time after there was like this fear state for kind of like the month after forty five days after that was i was just sort of like drifting through the days i was so out of it i was feeling so down just on a personal psychological level yeah really painful and hard to like have to keep running open ai in the middle of that i just wanted to like crawl into a cave and kind of recover for a while but you know now it's like we're just back to working on the mission well it's still useful to go back there and reflect on board structures on power dynamics on how companies are run the tension between research and product development and money and all this kind of stuff so that you who have a very high potential of building agi would do so in a slightly more organized less dramatic way in the future so there's value there to go both the personal psychological aspects of you as a leader and also just the board structure and all this kind of messy stuff definitely learned a lot about structure and incentives and what we need out of a board and i think that is it is valuable that this happened now in some sense i think this is probably not like the last high stress moment of open ai but it was quite a high stress moment like company very nearly got destroyed and we think a lot about many of the other things we've got to get right for agi but thinking about how to build a resilient org and how to build a structure that will stand up to like a lot of pressure in the world which i expect more and more as we get closer i think that's super important do you have a sense of how deep and rich",
