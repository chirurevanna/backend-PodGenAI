  "transcription": "what to you is the probability that superintelligent ai will destroy all human civilization what's the timeframe let's say a hundred years in the next hundred years so the problem of controlling a gi or superintelligence in my opinion is like a problem of creating a perpetual safety machine biology with perpetual motion machine it's impossible yeah we may succeed and do a good job with gpt five six seven but they just keep improving learning eventually self modifying interacting with the environment interacting with malevolent actors the difference between cybersecurity narrow ai safety and safety for generally for superintelligence is that we don't get a second chance with cybersecurity somebody hacks your account what's the big deal you get a new password new credit card you move on here if we're talking about existential risks you only get one chance so you're really asking me what are the chances that we'll create the most complex software ever on the first try with zero bugs and it will continue have zero bugs for a hundred years or more so there is an incremental improvement of systems leading up to agi to you it doesn't matter if we can keep those safe there's going to be one level of system at which you cannot possibly control it i don't think we so far have made any system safe at the level of capability they display they already have made mistakes we had accidents they've been drill broken i don't think there is a single large language model today which no one was successful at making making do something developers didn't intend it to do but there's a difference between getting it to do something unintended getting it to do something that's painful costly destructive and something that's destructive to the level of hurting billions of people or hundreds of millions of people billions of people or the entirety of human civilization that's a big leap exactly but the systems we have today have capability of causing x amount of damage so when they fail that's all we get if we systems capable of impacting all of humanity all of universe the damage is proportionate what to you are the possible ways that such kind of mass murder of humans can happen it's always a wonderful question so one of the chapters in my new book is about unpredictability i argue that we cannot predict what a smarter system will do so you're really not asking me how superintelligence will kill everyone you're asking me how i would do it and i think it's not that interesting i can tell you about a standard you know nanotech synthetic bionuclear superintelligence will come up with something completely new completely super we may not even recognize that as a possible path to achieve that goal so there's like an unlimited level of creativity in terms of how humans could be killed but you know we could still investigate possible ways of doing it not how to do it but the at the end what is the methodology that does it you know shutting off the power and then humans start killing each other maybe because the resources are really constrained that there and then there's the actual use of weapons like nuclear weapons or developing artificial pathogens viruses that kind of stuff we could still kind of think through that and defend against it right there's a ceiling to the creativity of mass murder of humans humans here right the options are limited they're limited by how imaginative we are if you are that much smarter that much more creative you are capable of thinking across multiple domains do novel research in physics and biology you may not be limited by those tools if squirrels were planning to kill humans they would have a set of possible ways of doing it but they would never consider things we can come up so you are you thinking about mass murder and destruction of human civilization are you thinking of with squirrels you put them in a zoo and they don't really know they're in a zoo if we just look at the entire set of undesirable trajectories majority of them are not going to be death most of them are going to be just like things like brave new world where you know the squirrels are fed dopamine and they're all like doing some kind of fun activity and the sort of the fire the soul of humanity is lost because of the drug that's fed to it or like literally in zoo we're in a zoo we're doing our thing we're like us playing a game of sims and the actual players playing that game are ai systems those are all undesirable because sort of the the free will the fire of human consciousness is dimmed through that process but it's not killing humans so like are you thinking about that or is the biggest concern literally the extinctions of humans i think about a lot of things so literally x risk existential risks everyone's dead there is s risk suffering risks where everyone wishes they were dead we have also idea for i risk ikigai risks where we lost our meaning the systems can be more creative they can do all the jobs it's not obvious what you have to contribute to a world where superintelligence exists of course you can have all the variants you mentioned where we are safe we are kept alive but we are not in control we are not deciding anything we're like animals in a zoo there is again possibilities we can come up with as very smart humans and then possibilities something a thousand times smarter can come up with for reasons we cannot comprehend i would love to sort of dig into each of those x risk s risk and i risk so can you like linger on i risk what is that so japanese concept of ikigai you find something which allows you to make money you are good at it and the society says we need it so like you have this awesome job you're a podcaster gives you a lot of meaning you have a good life i assume you're happy that's what we want most people to find to have for many intellectuals it is their occupation which gives them a lot of meaning i'm a researcher philosopher scholar that means something to me in a world where an artist is not feeling appreciated because his art is just not competitive with what is produced by machines or a writer or scientist will lose a lot of that and at the lower level we're talking about complete technological unemployment we're not losing ten percent of jobs we're losing all jobs what do people do with all that free time what happens then everything society is built on is completely modified in one generation it's not a slow process where we get to kind of figure out how to live that new lifestyle but it's pretty quick in that world can't humans just do what he was currently do with chess play each other have tournaments even though ai systems are far superior at this time in chess so we just create artificial games or for us they're real like the olympics and we do all kinds of different competitions and have fun focus maximize the fun and let the ai focus on the productivity it's an option i have a paper where i try to solve the value alignment problem for multiple agents and the solution to avoid compromise is to give everyone a personal virtual universe you can do whatever you want in that world you could be king you could be slave you decide what happens so it's basically a glorified video game where you get to enjoy yourself and someone else takes care of your needs and the substrate alignment is the only thing we need to solve we don't have to get eight billion humans to agree on anything so okay so what why is that not a likely outcome why can't ai systems create video games for us to lose ourselves in each each with an individual video game universe some people say that's what happened we're in a simulation and we're playing that video game and now we're creating what maybe we're creating artificial threats for ourselves to be scared about because because fear is really exciting it allows us to play the video game more more vigorously and some people choose to play on a more difficult level with more constraints some say okay i'm just going to enjoy the game high privilege level absolutely so okay what was that paper on multi agent value alignment personal universes personal universes so so that's one of the possible outcomes but what what what in general is the idea of the paper so it's looking at multiple agents they're human ai like a hybrid system where there's humans and ais or is it looking at humans or just so this intelligent agents in order to solve value alignment problem i'm trying to formalize it a little better usually we're talking about getting ais to do what we want which is not well defined are we talking about creator of a system owner of that ai humanity as a whole but we don't agree on much there is no universally accepted ethics morals across",
