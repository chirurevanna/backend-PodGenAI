  "transcription": "this is so great lighting change wow yeah we can put the light anywhere and it doesn't feel awkward to be really close to you no it does i actually moved you i moved you back a few feet before you got involved you were like right here i don't know if people can see this but this is incredible the realism here is just incredible where am i where are you mark where are we you're in austin right no i mean this place where we're surrounded by darkness with ultra realistic face and just feels like we're in the same room this is really the most incredible thing i've ever seen and sorry to be in your personal space i mean we have done jejesa before yeah no i was i was commenting to the team before that even i feel like we've choked each other from further distances than it feels like we are i mean this is just really incredible i don't know how to describe with words it really feels like it feels like we're in the same room yeah feels like the future this is truly truly incredible i just want to take it in i'm still getting used to it's like it's you it's really you but you're not here with me right you're there with wearing a headset and i'm wearing a headset it's really really incredible so what can you describe what it takes currently for us to appear so photorealistic to each other yeah so i mean for background we both did these scans for this research project that that we have at meta called kodak avatars and the idea is that instead of actually instead of our avatars being cartoony and instead of actually transmitting a video what it does is we've sort of scanned ourselves and a lot of different expressions and we've built a computer model of sort of each of our faces and bodies and the different expressions that we make and collapse that into a codec that then when you have the headset on your head it can it sees your face it sees your expression and it can basically send an encoded version of what you're supposed to look like over the wire so so in addition to being photorealistic it's also actually much more bandwidth efficient than transmitting a full video or especially a three d immersive video of a whole scene like this and it captures everything like the flaws like to me the subtleties of the human face like even the flaws that's like that's all amazing it makes you it makes it so much more immersive it makes you realize that like performance perfection isn't the thing that leads to immersion it's like the little subtle flaws like freckles and like variations in color and just yeah wrinkles all stuff yeah asymmetry and just different like the corners of the eyes like what your eyes do when you smile all that kind of stuff yeah eyes there are a huge part of it yeah i mean there's all the studies that most of communication even when people are speaking is not actually the words that they're saying right it's kind of the expression and and all that so and we try to capture that with the kind of classical expressive avatar system that we have that's the kind of more cartoon designed one you can you can kind of put those kind of expressions on those faces as well but there's obviously a certain realism that comes with delivering kind of this photorealistic experience that i don't know i just think it's really magical i mean this gets to kind of the core of what the vision around virtual and augmented reality is of like delivering a sense of presence as if you're there together no matter where you actually are in the world and i mean this this experience i think is a good embodiment of that where it's like i mean we're in two completely different states halfway across the country and it just like you know looks like you're just sitting right in front of me it's it's pretty wild yeah yeah i can't it's i'm almost getting emotional it's like it feels like a totally it's fundamentally new experience like for me to have this kind of conversations with loved ones it would just change everything maybe just to elaborate so the i went to pittsburgh and went through this whole scanning procedure which has so much incredible technology so software and hardware going on but it is a lengthy process so what's your vision for the future of this in terms of making this more accessible to people you know it starts off with a small number of people doing these very detailed scans right which is this that's the version that you did and that i did and you know before there are a lot of people",
