  "transcription": "you mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time so let's start with a wild question do you think time is an illusion you know i sell phone calls to comma for a thousand dollars and some guy called me and like you know it's a thousand dollars you can talk to me for half an hour and he's like yeah okay so like time doesn't exist and i really wanted to share this with you i'm like well what do you mean time doesn't exist right like i think time is a useful model whether it exists or not right like does quantum physics exist well it doesn't matter it's about whether it's a useful model to describe reality is time maybe compressive do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models like underneath it all is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for i don't know i was hoping you would know i don't think it matters i mean this kind of connects to the models of constructed reality with machine learning right sure like is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it so there are things that are real colomograph complexity is real yeah yeah the compressive thing math is real yeah should be a t shirt and i think hard things are actually hard i don't think p equals np ooh strong words well i think that's the majority i do think factoring is np but i don't think you're the person that falls the majority in all walks of life so it's good for that one i do yeah in theoretical computer science you're one of the sheep all right but do you time is a useful model sure hmm what were you talking about on the stream with time are you made of time if i remembered half the thing i said on stream someday someone's going to make a model of all of it and it's going to come back to haunt me someday soon yeah probably would that be exciting to you or sad that there's a george hotts model i mean the question is when the george hott's model is better than george hotts like i am declining and the model is growing what is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that if you're competing with yourself maybe you can just play a game where you have the george hott's answer and the model answer and ask which people prefer people close to you or strangers either one it will hurt more when it's people close to me but both will be overtaken by the george hotz model it'd be quite painful right loved ones family members would rather have the model over for thanksgiving than you yeah or like significant others would rather sext with the with the large language model version of you view especially when it's fine tuned to their preferences yeah well that's what we're doing in a relationship right we're just fine tuning ourselves but we're inefficient with it because we're selfish and greedy and so on a language models can fine tune more efficiently more selflessly there's a star trek voyager episode where you know catherine janeway lost in the delta quadrant makes herself a lover on the holodeck and the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit and you know janeway edits the program to remove that and then of course the realization is wait this person's terrible it is actually all their nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that make this relationship worthwhile but i don't think we're going to realize that until it's too late well i think a large language model could incorporate the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff just the perfect amount of quirks and floor flaws to make you charming without crossing the line yeah yeah and that's probably a good like approximation of the like the percent of time the language model should be cranky or an asshole or jealous or all this kind of stuff and of course it can and it will but all that difficulty at that point is artificial there's no more real difficulty okay what's the difference between real and artificial artificial difficulty is difficulty that's like constructed it or could be turned off with a knob real difficulty is like you're in the woods and you gotta survive so if something cannot be turned off with a knob it's real yeah i think so or i mean you can't get out of this by smashing the knob with a hammer i mean maybe you kind of can you know into the wild when you know alexander supertramp he wants to explore something that's never been explored before but it's the nineties everything's been explored so he's like well i'm just not going to bring a map yeah i mean no you're you're not exploring you should have brought a map dude you died there was a bridge a mile from where you were camping how does that connect to the metaphor of the knob by not bringing the map you didn't become an explorer you just smashed the thing yeah yeah the art the difficulty is still artificial you failed before you started what if we just don't have access to the knob well that maybe is even scarier right like we're exist in a world of nature and nature has been fine tuned over billions of years yeah to have humans build something and then throw the knob away in some grand romantic gesture is horrifying do you think of us humans as individuals that are like born and die or is it are we just all part of one living organism that is earth that is nature i don't think there's a clear line there i think it's all kind of just fuzzy i don't know i mean i don't think i'm conscious i don't think i'm anything i think i'm just a computer program so it's all computation everything running in your head is just a is a is computation everything running in the universe is computation i think i believe the extended church taring thesis yeah but there seems to be an embodiment to your particular computation like there's a consistency well yeah but i mean models have consistency too yeah models that have been rlhfed will continually say you know like well how do i murder ethnic minorities oh well i can't let you do that al there's a consistency to that behavior it's all rlhf like we rlhf each other we we find we provide human feedback and there that thereby fine tune these little pockets of computation but it's still unclear why that pocket of computation stays with you like for years it just kind of fall like you have this consistent set of physics biology what like whatever you call the neurons firing like the electrical signals and mechanical signals all of that that seems to stay there and it contains information stores information and that information permeates through time and stays with you there's like memory it's like sticky okay to be fair like a lot of the models we're building today are very even rlhf is nowhere near as complex as the human loss function reinforcement learning with human feedback you know when i talked about will gpt twelve be agi my answer is no of course not i mean cross centropry loss is never going to get you there you need probably rl in fancy environments in order to get something that would be considered like agi like so to ask like the question about like why i don't know like it's just some quirk of evolution right i don't think there's anything particularly special about where i ended up where humans ended up so okay we have human level intelligence would you call that agi whatever we have gi look actually i don't really even like the word agi but general intelligence is defined to be whatever humans have okay so why can gpt twelve not get us to agi can we just like linger on that if your loss function is categorical cross entrance if your loss function is just try to maximize compression i have a soundcloud i rap and i tried to get chat gpt to help me write raps and the raps that it wrote sounded like youtube comment raps you know you can go on any rap beat online and you can see what people put in the comments and it's the most like mid quality rap you can find is mid good or bad mid is bad it's like mid it's like every time i talk to you i learn new words mid mid yeah i was like is it is it like basic is that what mid means kind of it's like it's like middle of the curve right yeah so there's like there's like i like that intelligence curve where and you have like the dumb guy the smart guy and then the mid guy actually being the mid guy is the worst the smart guy is like i put all my money in bitcoin the mid guy is like you can't put money in bitcoin it's not real money and all of it is a genius meme that's another interesting one memes the humor the idea the absurdity encapsulated in a single image and it just kind of propagates virally between all of our brains i didn't get much sleep last night so i'm very i sound like i'm high i swear i'm not do you think we have ideas or ideas have us i think that we're going to get super scary memes once the ai is actually are superhuman ooh like you think ai will generate memes of course you think it'll make humans laugh",
