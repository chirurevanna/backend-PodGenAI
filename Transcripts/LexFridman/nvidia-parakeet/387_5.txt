  "transcription": "you mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time so let's start with a wild question do you think time is an illusion you know i sell phone calls to comma for a thousand dollars and some guy called me and like you know it's a thousand dollars you can talk to me for half an hour and he's like yeah okay so like time doesn't exist and i really wanted to share this with you i'm like well what do you mean time doesn't exist right like i think time is a useful model whether it exists or not right like does quantum physics exist well it doesn't matter it's about whether it's a useful model to describe reality is time maybe compressive do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models like underneath it all is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for i don't know i was hoping you would know i don't think it matters i mean this kind of connects to the models of constructed reality with machine learning right sure like is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it so there are things that are real colomograph complexity is real yeah yeah the compressive thing math is real yeah should be a t shirt and i think hard things are actually hard i don't think p equals np ooh strong words well i think that's the majority i do think factoring is np but i don't think you're the person that falls the majority in all walks of life so it's good for that one i do yeah in theoretical computer science you're one of the sheep all right but do you time is a useful model sure hmm what were you talking about on the stream with time are you made of time if i remembered half the thing i said on stream someday someone's going to make a model of all of it and it's going to come back to haunt me someday soon yeah probably would that be exciting to you or sad that there's a george hotts model i mean the question is when the george hott's model is better than george hotts like i am declining and the model is growing what is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that if you're competing with yourself maybe you can just play a game where you have the george hott's answer and the model answer and ask which people prefer people close to you or strangers either one it will hurt more when it's people close to me but both will be overtaken by the george hotz model it'd be quite painful right loved ones family members would rather have the model over for thanksgiving than you yeah or like significant others would rather sext with the with the large language model version of you view especially when it's fine tuned to their preferences yeah well that's what we're doing in a relationship right we're just fine tuning ourselves but we're inefficient with it because we're selfish and greedy and so on a language models can fine tune more efficiently more selflessly there's a star trek voyager episode where you know catherine janeway lost in the delta quadrant makes herself a lover on the holodeck and the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit and you know janeway edits the program to remove that and then of course the realization is wait this person's terrible it is actually all their nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that make this relationship worthwhile but i don't think we're going to realize that until it's too late well i think a large language model could incorporate the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff just the perfect amount of quirks and floor flaws to make you charming without crossing the line yeah yeah and that's probably a good like approximation of the like the percent of time the language model should be cranky or an asshole or jealous or all this kind of stuff and of course it can and it will but all that difficulty at that point is artificial there's no more real difficulty okay what's the difference between real and artificial artificial difficulty is difficulty that's like constructed it or could be turned off with a knob real difficulty is like you're in the woods and you gotta survive so if something cannot be turned off with a knob it's real yeah i think so or i mean you can't get out of this by smashing the knob with a hammer i mean maybe you kind of can you know into the wild when you know alexander supertramp he wants to explore something that's never been explored before but it's the nineties everything's been explored so he's like well i'm just",
