  "transcription": " This is so great Lighting change Wow Yeah, if you put the light anywhere And it doesn't feel awkward to be really close to you No, it does I actually moved you I moved you back a few feet before you got into the headset you were like right here I don't know if people can see this but this is incredible. The realism here is just incredible Where am I? Where are you mark? Where are we? You're in Austin, right? No, I mean this place Where we're surrounded by darkness with ultra realistic Face and just feels like we're in the same room. This is really the most incredible thing I've ever seen. And sorry to be in your personal space. I mean, we have done to just before. Yeah, I was I was commenting to the team before that even that I feel like we've choked each other from further distances than it feels like we are. I mean, this is just really incredible. I don't know how to describe it with words. It really feels like it feels like we're in the same room. Yeah, feels like the future. This is truly, truly incredible. I just wanted to take it in. I'm still getting used to it. It's like, it's you, it's really you. But you're not here with me, right? You're there wearing a headset and I'm wearing a headset. It's really, really incredible. So what, can you describe what it takes currently for us to appear so photorealistic to each other? Yeah, so I mean for background, we both did these scans for this research project that we have at Meta called Codec Avatars. And the idea is that instead of actually, instead of our avatars being cartoony, and instead of actually transmitting a video, what it does is we've sort of scanned ourselves and a lot of different expressions and we've built a computer model of sort of each of our faces and bodies and the different expressions that we make and collapse that into a Kodak that then when you have the headset on your head, it sees your face, it sees your expression, and it can basically send an encoded version of what you're supposed to look like over the wire. So in addition to being photorealistic, it's also actually much more bandwidth efficient than transmitting a full video or especially a 3D immersive video of a whole scene like this. And it captures everything. Like the flaws, like to me, the subtleties of the human face, like even the flaws, that's like, that's all amazing. It makes you, it makes us so much more immersive. It makes you realize that like perfection isn't the thing that leads to immersion. It's like the little subtle flaws like freckles and like variations in color and just yeah wrinkles all stuff noses Yeah, asymmetry and just a different like the corners of the eyes like what your eyes do when you smile all that kind of stuff Yeah, eyes are a huge part of it. Yeah, I mean there's all the studies that most of Communication even when people speaking, is not actually the words that they're saying, right? It's kind of the expression and all that. So we try to capture that with the kind of classical expressive avatar system that we have. That's the kind of more cartoon designed one, you can you can kind of put those kind of expressions on those faces as well. But there's obviously a certain realism that comes with delivering kind of this photorealistic experience that I just think it's really magical. I mean, this gets to kind of the core of what the vision around virtual and augmented reality is of like delivering a sense of presence as if you're there together, no matter where you actually are in the world. And I mean, this this experience, I think, is a good embodiment of that, where it's like, I mean, we're in two completely different states halfway across the country. And it just like, you know, it looks like you're just sitting right in front of me. It's, uh, it's pretty wild. Yeah. I can't, it's almost getting emotional. It's like, it feels like a totally fundamentally new experience. Like for me to have this kind of conversations with loved ones, it would just change everything. Maybe just to elaborate, so I went to Pittsburgh and went through the whole scanning procedure, which has so much incredible technology, so software and hardware going on, but it is a lengthy process. So what's your vision for the future of this in terms of making this more accessible to people? You know, it starts off with a small number of people doing these very detailed scans, right? Which is this that's the version that you did and that I did and you know before there are a lot of people who who we've done this kind of a for, we probably need to kind of over collect expressions when we're doing the scanning because we haven't figured out how much we can reduce that down to a really streamlined process and extrapolate from the the the scans that have already been done. But the goal and we have a project that's working on this already is just to do a very scan with your cell phone, where you just take your phone, kind of wave it in front of your face for a couple of minutes, say a few sentences, make a bunch of expressions, but overall have the whole process just be two to three minutes and then produce something that's of the quality of what we have right now. So I think that that's one of the big challenges that remains. And right now we have the ability to do the scans if you have hours to sit for one. And with today's technology, I mean, you're using a meta headset that exists. It's a product that's kind of for sale now. You can drive these with that. But the production of these scans in a very efficient way is one of the last pieces that we still need to really nail. And then obviously, there's all the experiences around it. I mean, right now, we're kind of sitting in a dark room, which is familiar for your podcast. But I think part of the vision for this over time is not just having this be like a video call. I mean, that's fine. It's cool. It feels like it's immersive, but you can do a video call on your phone. The thing that you can do in the metaverse that is different from what you can do on a phone is like doing stuff where you're physically there together and participating in things together. And we could play games like this. We could have meetings like this in the future. Once you get mixed reality and augmented reality, we could have codec avatars like this and go into a meeting and have some people physically there and have some people show up in this photorealistic form superimposed on the physical environment. Stuff like that is going to be super powerful. So we got to still build out all those kind of applications and the use cases around it. But I don't know, I think it's going to be a pretty wild next few years around this. I'm actually almost at a loss of words. This is just so incredible. This is truly incredible. I hope that people watching this can get a glimpse of how incredible it is. It really feels like we're in the same room. There is that, I guess there's an uncanny valley that seems to have been crossed here. It looks like you. Like the real you. There's still a bunch of tuning that I think we'll want to do where different people emote to different extents. I think So I think one of the big questions is, you know, like when you smile, how wide is your smile and how wide do you want your smile to be? And I think getting that to be tuned on a per person basis is gonna be one of the things that we're gonna need to figure out. You know, it's like, to what extent do you want to give people control over that? Some people might try to, might prefer a version of themselves that's more emotive in their avatar than their actual faces. So for example, I always get a lot of critique and shit for having a relatively stiff expression. But I might feel pretty happy, but just make a pretty small smile. So maybe for me, it's actually, it's like I'd want to have my avatar really be able to better express how I'm feeling than how I can do physically. So I think that there's a question about how you want to tune that. But overall, yeah, we want to start from the baseline of capturing how people actually emote and express themselves. And I think that there's a question about how you want to tune that. But overall, yeah, I mean, we want to start from the baseline of capturing how people actually emote and express themselves. And I think the initial version of this has been pretty impressive. And like you said, I do think we're kind of beyond the uncanny valley here, where it does feel like you. It doesn't feel weird or anything like that. but I'm not, it's just this, maybe my expression of emotion is more subtle usually, like with the eyes. And that's one of the things I've noticed is just how expressive the subtle movement of the corners of the eyes are in terms of displaying happiness or boredom or all that kind of stuff. I am curious to see, just because I've never done one of these before, I've never done a podcast as one of these codec avatars. And I'm curious to see what people think of it because one of the issues that we've had in some of the VR and mixed reality work is it tends to feel a lot more profound when you're in it than the 2D videos capturing the experience. So I think that this one, because it's photorealistic,",
