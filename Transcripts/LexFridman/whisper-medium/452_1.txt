  "transcription": " All right, this is awesome. We have Michael, Aman, Swale, Arvid here from the cursor team. First up, big ridiculous question. What's the point of a code editor? So the code editor is largely the place where you build software. And today, or for a long time, that's meant the place where you text edit a formal programming language. And for people who aren't programmers, the way to think of a code editor is like a really souped up word processor for programmers. Where the reason it's souped up is code has a lot of structure. And so the quote unquote word processor, the code editor can actually do a lot for you that word processors, you know, sort of in the writing space haven't been able to do for people editing text there. That's everything from giving you visual differentiation of the actual tokens in the code so you can scan it quickly to letting you navigate around the code base, like you're navigating around the internet with hyperlinks. You're going to definitions of things you're using to error checking."
