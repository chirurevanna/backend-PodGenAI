  "transcription": " This is so great. Lighting change. Wow. Yeah, we can put the light anywhere. And it doesn't feel awkward to be really close to you. No, it does. I actually moved you back a few feet before you got into the headset. You were like right here. I don't know if people can see this, but this is incredible. The realism here is just incredible. Where am I? Where are you, Mark? Where are we? You're in Austin, right? No, I mean this place. We're shrouded by darkness with ultra-realistic face, face and just feels like we're in the same room this is really the most incredible thing i've ever seen and sorry to be in your personal space i mean we have done jiu-jitsu before yeah no i was i was commenting to the team before that even that i feel like we've choked each other from further distances than it feels like we are right now. I mean, this is just really incredible. I don't know how to describe it with words. It really feels like we're in the same room. It feels like the future. This is truly, truly incredible. I just wanted to take it in. I'm still getting used to it. It's like, it's you, it's really you, but you're not here with me, right? You're there wearing a headset and I'm wearing a headset. It's, it's really, really incredible. So what, um, can you describe what it takes currently for us to appear so photorealistic to each other? Yeah. So, I mean, for,, we both did these scans for this research project that we have at Meta called Codec Avatars. And the idea is that instead of actually, instead of our avatars being cartoony, and instead of actually transmitting a video, what it does is we've sort of scanned ourselves and a lot of different expressions, and we've built a computer model of sort of each of our faces and bodies and the different expressions that we make and collapse that into a codec that then when you have the headset on your head, it sees your face, it sees your expression, and it can basically send an encoded version of what you're supposed to look like over the wire. So in addition to being photorealistic, it's also actually much more bandwidth efficient than transmitting a full video or especially a 3D immersive video of a whole scene like this. And it captures everything like the flaws, like to me, the subtleties of the human face, like even the flaws, that's like, that's all amazing. It makes you, it makes it so much more immersive. It makes you realize that like perfection isn't the thing that leads to immersion. It's like the little subtle flaws, like freckles and variations in color and just... Yeah, wrinkles. All stuff about noses. Yeah, asymmetry. And just the different corners of the eyes, like what your eyes do when you smile, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, eyes are a huge part of it. Yeah, I mean, there's all the studies that most of communication, even when people are speaking is not actually the words that they're saying, right. It's, it's kind of the expression and all that. So, and we try to capture that with the kind of classical, um, expressive avatar system that we have. That's the kind of more cartoon designed one. You can, you can kind of put those kinds of expressions on those faces as well, but there's obviously a certain realism that comes with delivering kind of this photorealistic experience that, I don't know, I just think it's really magical. I mean, this gets to kind of the core of what the vision around virtual and augmented reality is of like delivering a sense of presence as if you're there together, no matter where you actually are in the world. And I mean, this experience, I think, is a good embodiment of that where it's like, I mean, we're in two completely different states halfway across the country. And it just like, you know, it looks like you're just sitting right in front of me. It's pretty wild. Yeah, I mean, I can't, I'm almost getting emotional. It's like, it feels like a totally, it's fundamentally new experience. Like for me to have this kind of conversations with loved ones, it would just change everything. Maybe just to elaborate. So I went to Pittsburgh and went through the whole scanning procedure, which has so much incredible technology, so software and hardware going on. But it is a lengthy process. So what's your vision for the future of this in terms of making this more accessible to people? You know, it starts off with a small number of people doing these very detailed scans, right? Which is, that's the version that you did and that I did. And, you know, before there were a lot of people",
