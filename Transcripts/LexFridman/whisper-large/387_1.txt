  "transcription": " You mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time. So let's start with a wild question. Do you think time is an illusion? You know, I sell phone calls to Kama for $1,000. And some guy called me and like, you know, it's $1,000. You can talk to me for half an hour. And he's like, yeah, okay. So like time doesn't exist. And I really wanted to share this with you. I'm like, oh, what do you mean time doesn't exist? Right? Like I think time is a useful model, whether it exists or not. Right?
