  "transcription": " You mentioned something in a stream about the philosophical nature of time. So let's start with a wild question. Do you think time is an illusion? You know, I sell phone calls to Kama for $1,000. And some guy called me and like, you know, it's $1,000. You can talk to me for half an hour. And he's like, yeah, okay. So like time doesn't exist. And I really wanted to share this with you. I'm like, oh, what do you mean time doesn't exist? Right? Like I think time is a useful model, whether it exists or not. Right? Like does quantum physics exist? Well, it doesn't matter. It's about whether it's a useful model to describe reality. Is time maybe compressive? Do you think there is an objective reality or is everything just useful models? Like, underneath it all, is there an actual thing that we're constructing models for? I don't know. I was hoping you would know. I don't think it matters. I mean, this kind of connects to the models of constructive reality with machine learning, right? Sure. Like, is it just nice to have useful approximations of the world such that we can do something with it? So there are things that are real. Colonograph complexity is real. Yeah. Yeah. The compressive thing. Math is real. Yeah. Should be a t-shirt. And I think hard things are actually hard. I don't think P equals NP. Ooh, strong words. Well, I think that's the majority. I do think factoring is in P, but. I don't think you're the person that follows the majority in all walks of life. Well, for that one, I do. Yeah. In theoretical computer science, you're one of the sheep. All right. But to you, time is a useful model. Sure. What were you talking about on the stream with time? Are you made of time? If I remembered half the things I said on stream. Someday someone's going to make a model of all of that, and it's going to come back to haunt me. Someday soon? Yeah, probably. Would that be exciting to you or sad that there's a George Hots model? I mean, the question is when the George Hots model is better than George Hots. Like I am declining and the model is growing. What is the metric by which you measure better or worse in that if you're competing with yourself? Maybe you can just play a game where you have the George Hott's answer and the George Hott's model answer and ask which people prefer. People close to you or strangers? Either one. It will hurt more when it's people close to me, but both will be overtaken by the George Hott's model. It'd be quite painful, right? Loved ones, family members would rather have the model over for Thanksgiving than you. Yeah. Or like significant others would rather sext with the large language model version of you. Especially when it's fine-tuned to their preferences. Yeah. Well, that's what we're doing in a relationship, right? We're just fine-tuning ourselves, but we're inefficient with it because we're selfish and greedy and so on. All language models can fine-tune more efficiently, more selflessly. There's a Star Trek Voyager episode where, you know, Catherine Janeway, lost in the Delta Quadrant, makes herself a lover on the holodeck. And the lover falls asleep on her arm and he snores a little bit. And Janeway edits the program to remove that. And then, of course, the realization is, wait, this person's terrible. It is actually all their nuances and quirks and slight annoyances that make this relationship worthwhile. But I don't think we're going to realize that until it's too late. Well, I think a large language model could incorporate the flaws and the quirks and all that kind of stuff. Just the perfect amount of quirks and flaws to make you charming without crossing the line. Yeah. Yeah. And that's probably a good, like, approximation of the, like, the percent of time the language model should be cranky or an asshole or jealous or all this kind of stuff. And of course it can and it will, but all that difficulty at that point is artificial. There's no more real difficulty. Okay. What's the difference between real and artificial? Artificial difficulty is difficulty that's like constructed or could be turned off with a knob. Real difficulty is like you're in the woods and you've got to survive. So if something can not be turned off with a knob, it's real. Yeah, I think so. Or, I mean, you can't get out of this by smashing the knob with a hammer I mean maybe you kind of can you know I into the wild when uh you know uh Alexander Supertramp he wants to explore something that's never been explored before but it's the 90s everything's been explored so he's like well I'm",
